"Please help!!! I'm 16, he's 17, it was our first time having sex, and I passed out in his arms!! Now he's...?!?","Ok, well, I recently started dating my friend Chris after agonizing over whether or not he liked me back for a long time. We've been close friends since we were little kids... He was 8, and I was 7. We're extremely close, and now that we've started dating, I've realized that I've loved him for quite some time now (and please don't say we can't love each other because we're only teenagers.) Well, now, he's 17, and I'm 16. We were both planning on waiting to have sex (We were both virgins)... He told me he wished we could, but he didn't want to disrespect me, or push me into it at all. I thought about it for a long time, and decided I was ready, and I really love him. So this afternoon, he came over, and we got in the shower together, and obviously... things happened... Everything was great, except for the fact that we were in there for a while, it was hot, and I hadn't eaten much that day... I blacked out, went to fall, and completely passed out in his arms for about 10 seconds. After that, he helped me out of the shower, and I just layed down on my bed, because I was still dizzy and didn't feel good. He held me until I could stand up without feeling so dizzy. He was so sweet and supportive about it, but now... he's been really reserved. I asked him what was wrong about an hour later when we were watching TV, and he was acting very quiet, reserved, and not himself, and he told me he thinks it's his fault that I passed out. It really traumatized him, I think, and he hardly touched me after that, like I'm made of glass... I think he's afraid that he'll cause something bad to happen to me, when really, me passing out was my fault for not eating much, etc. I told him this, but he's just... not himself... Why is he being like this? I'm worried about him... What should I do?!",Singles & Dating,Family & Relationships,http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090720194256AA9AaWS,1
