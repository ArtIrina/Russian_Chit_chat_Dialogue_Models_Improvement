168594,A,"Yeah,",aa

168597,B,"Yeah,",aa
168598,B,"and I think it's more convenient, too, in a lot of cases,",sv
168599,B,"like whenever we go on trips, we always, you know, use our, our Visa or our Mastercard or whatever.",sd
168600,A,Yeah.,b

168602,A,"Uh-huh,",b
168603,A,uh-huh.,b
168604,B,"and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it,",sd

168606,A,"Uh-huh,",b
168607,A,"uh-huh,",b
168608,A,uh-huh.,b
168609,A,"Yeah,",b
168610,A,"well, I think it's better to use credit cards, too, like I say, because there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing",sv
168611,B,"Oh, yeah.",b
168612,A,"and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket, they're going to hit you over the head.",sv

168614,B,"even if it's five bucks, even.",sv
168615,A,I know.,aa

168618,A,"I'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off, you know.",sd
168619,B,Yeah.,b
168620,B,"And also, if you, if someone did happen to steal your credit card, my husband was saying that if, you know, you notice it within, I think it's twenty-four hours, you can report it in,",sd
168621,B,"and I, he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel, you know, whatever payments you had,",sd
168622,B,"and if whoever tried to, uh, you know, credit it to the hilt, you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it,",sd
168623,A,Right.,b

169066,A,"or, you know, in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do.",sv
169067,B,Right.,b
169068,A,"And, uh, I, as far as a high school course, I could see it as, uh, maybe a social, uh, sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program",sv
169069,B,Uh-huh.,b
169070,A,"and  to me, that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year",sv
169071,B,Uh-huh.,b
169072,B,Uh-huh.,b
169073,A,"but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter, post high school, of community service, I, I'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do.",sv
169074,B,"Um. Well, that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to, uh, mandatory.",sv
169075,A,Uh-huh.,b
169076,A,Exactly.,aa
169077,B,Yeah.,b
169078,B,"A,",%

169080,B,I kind of agree with that.,aa

169083,A,Right.,b
169084,A,Right,b
169085,B,"It shouldn't be, uh, anything shouldn't be mandatory, other than, I guess, like, uh, when you come to paying taxes or something like that.",sv
169086,B,"Uh, or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe uh, people be more eager to do it.",sv
169087,A,Uh-huh.,b
169088,A,Exactly.,aa
169089,B,Yeah.,b
169090,A,And doing it for a purpose that they want.,sv
169091,A,"The other thing is this,",sv
169092,A,"I have thought about this on many times when you get these, uh, young troubled teenagers that, uh, don't have like the perspective of, uh, uh, of the community, a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems",sv
169093,A,but there are other people out in the community that may have problems.,sv
169094,A,Then I can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing.,sv
169095,A,You have to do so much as far as in  community service now.,sv
169096,B,Right.,b
169097,A,"If they were, you know, abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse.",sv
169098,B,Uh-huh.,b
169099,A,"Or if, uh, they destroyed some property around the, uh, area, then they would have to do, uh, to restore it and perhaps, uh, work, uh, for the community to beautify it or whatever",sv
169100,A,"but I could see that working in you know, cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever.",sv
169101,B,Uh-huh.,b
169102,A,"And that's, I think they have done that",sd
169103,A,"and judges have said well, you know, this is what you're going to get for a, you know, a misdemeanor or something,",sd
169104,A,you may end up having to do some kind of community service,^q
169105,A,"so I could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled,",sv

169107,B,Uh-huh.,aa
169108,B,"Uh, that's a good idea.",ba
169109,B,"Uh, I think they should have more programs like that.",sv
169110,A,Uh-huh.,b
169111,B,"And I think, uh, us being taxpayers, we pay for, uh, people that's in jail or in trouble anyway.",sv
169112,A,Uh-huh.,b
169113,A,Sure.,aa
169114,A,We sure do.,aa
169115,B,So they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas,sv

169118,A,Yeah.,b
169119,A,Yeah.,b
169120,B,Yeah.,b^m
169121,B,"But, uh, the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on, uh",sv
169122,A,Yeah.,b
169123,B,"because like you say, is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors",aa
169124,A,Uh-huh.,b
169125,B,so why have someone in jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor.,qh
169126,B,"And sometimes, you know, putting them in jail doesn't really help because there's nothing in there that would rehabilitate   rehabilitate  rehabilitate them",sv
169127,A,Uh-huh.,b
169128,A,Exactly.,aa
169129,A,Yeah.,b
169130,A,Uh-huh.,b
169131,B,"and then when they get out, they,",sv
169132,B,because they have this stigmatism of being in jail.,sv
169133,A,"And there's a lot of anger, sure. You know, especially if they haven't went through treatment",sv
169134,A,"and they dealt with other people in the, uh, system of prisons which, uh, you, you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever.",sv
169135,A,"I would say the crimes would probably be, you know,",sv
169136,A,"if you went in for a certain crime, there might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have,",sv
169137,A,"so you're dealing with people, uh, that may, uh, be an influence later on",sv
169138,A,"and, uh, an issue of anger would be is that I went to prison for a year or two",sv
169139,A,but I didn't get any rehabilitation,^q
169140,B,Uh-huh.,b
169141,A,"or, uh, you know. But then again, those that have physically assaulted somebody, uh, that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in  the community if they're of a violent sort and to say",sv
169142,B,Uh-huh.,b
169143,B,Right.,b
169144,A,"Uh, I don't know about you,",h

169146,A,"and, uh, in fact, uh, I'll be leaving very shortly to go to work",sd
169147,A,and I work different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where I don't have I don't have the family time.,sd
169148,A,"Uh, when my husband gets home, it's usually, he's home with my daughter alone",sd
169149,A,and then a couple of hours later I'm home.,sd
169150,A,"Uh, I don't know,",h
169151,A,"I'm finding that more and more people that I talk to, there's less and less family time available to them.",sd
169152,A,"And, uh, it seems that business wise, uh, in the business community, or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family.",sv
169153,A,"So, you know, if you do have any time, it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done, uh, just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then, plus try to have that relationship with your children,",sv
169154,A,"and it, it's sometimes a very, it, it's a very hard juggling act.",sv
169155,B,I agree,aa

169157,A,"and she's now, uh, four, going to be four",sd

169171,A,Sure.,aa

169189,A,"Sure,",b
169190,A,sure.,b

169206,A,I think so too.,aa
169207,A,"In fact, uh, I spent the first three years at home with my daughter,",sd
169208,A,"so I, I guess I felt fairly fortunate that I was able to do that.",sd
169209,A,And I did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare,sd
169210,A,"and I thought to myself, how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks,",sv
169211,A,"whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work, whether it be six weeks or three or four.",sv

169214,A,"this, uh, you need this job.",^q
169215,A,It's a little bit financial type thing,sv

169217,A,and  that's part of it too.,sv
169218,B,Right.,b
169219,A,"But, uh, like my husband was saying, maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties, uh, were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision, well, jeez, you know, I'll go out and get a part-time job.",sv

169251,A,"Should,",%
169252,B,"Um, I like the idea of nursing homes as a, as a growing the choices you have in nursing homes now, whereas used to, you used to have only, you put, you know,",sv
169253,B,"when, when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves",sv
169254,A,Uh-huh.,b
169255,B,and there was no other choice.,sv
169256,B,"You couldn't take them in your own home,",sv

169258,B,"You know, maybe you lived too far away to care for them,",sv
169259,A,Right.,b
169260,B,or your daily job or whatever prevented it.,sv
169261,B,"But, um, I like the choices you have now, where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some, basically have a independent life-style, but assisted care.",sd
169262,A,Yeah.,b
169263,B,"And then if things deteriorate, they can go to a second level which is, you know, like, where they prepare their meals for them",sv
169264,A,Uh-huh.,b
169265,B,"and, and they still live somewhat independently",sv
169266,B,but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals.,sv
169267,A,Uh-huh.,b
169268,B,"And then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level, which is full care, you know, where some people can't, where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed,",sv
169269,A,Uh-huh.,b
169270,B,and they can't get around,sv
169271,B,but then they have full care.,sv
169272,B,"But I really like those, those options now,",sd
169273,B,"and, and I think about it more often because my husband's parents are, they're very active right now,",sd
169274,B,"but they're seventy-five and, and seventy-two.",sd
169275,B,"So, that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as I see these things because of their age.",sd

169284,A,"they, we call it, um,",%
169285,A,"well, we have high rises,",sd
169286,A,"and it's just for elderly people, you know,",sd

169296,A,"she lived with us for, um, three months, and, because she's starting to get Alzheimer's disease.",sd
169297,A,"And I know I have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters,",sd

169304,A,Uh-huh.,b
169305,B,"And, uh, and the programs,",sd
169306,B,"here they have different, uh, besides just different levels within the same program, they have different types of programs.",sd
169307,B,They have several areas.,sd
169308,B,"They have one area in town where the people,",sd
169309,B,I guess a lot of it comes with money.,sd
169310,B,"I, this, this one area is a bit more expensive,",sd
169311,B,and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life.,sd
169312,B,"But, but things that people where they have similar interests.",sd
169313,A,Uh-huh.,b
169314,B,"Like you're saying,",sd
169315,B,"and the programs that they have, where, where some of them will have dances once a week",sd
169316,A,Yeah.,b
169317,B,"and some of them sponsor different crafts,",sd
169318,B,"and they go to the arboretum to see things,",sd
169319,B,"and they make sure that if they want to go to church, there's a bus there.",sd
169320,A,Uh-huh.,b
169321,B,"And, it'll, or, you know, or someone will transport them to a specific church, even though it's, you know, maybe it's thirty minutes away,",sd
169322,B,"because it's a big, you know, Dallas area is a big metropolitan area.",sd
169323,A,Yeah,b
169324,B,"But a lot of these places have, have churches or have, have individual transportation.",sd
169325,B,"That's, that's something I'd look for, something that would make me happy personally if I had to live there.",sd
169326,A,Uh-huh.,b
169327,B,"Because I don't think a lot of people really, even in the nice ones, and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently, they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home.",sv
169328,A,Yeah.,b
169329,A,Uh-huh.,b
169330,B,"So I think those kinds of things, to make it more homelike and to make it more, um, enjoyable for them. That'd, that'd be one thing I'd look for, along with the, uh, health care aspects to make sure they had, you know, that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses.",sv

169337,B,Uh-huh.,b
169338,A,"And I was so surprised to hear how many people,",sd
169339,A,"like whenever they're in, you know, the older people, they're like, um, fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they, you know, they wander the halls. And they get the wrong medicine, just because, you know, the, the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine.",sv
169340,B,Uh-huh.,b
169341,B,Yeah.,b

169344,A,Yes.,aa
169345,A,"And it was, it was awful to hear what, you know, what some of these people really went through.",sd

169348,B,Uh-huh.,b
169349,B,"Yeah,",b
169350,B,"that's one of the things that, that we don't think about as we get older, and the, the money that it now requires to, uh, be in one of these places.",sv
169351,B,"Because some of these people that are just on social security,",sv
169352,B,"and if they don't have any living relatives,",sv
169353,B,perhaps they never had children,sv
169354,B,"or if their children, you know, passed away before they did they can be in some places that are, you know, that, that are not good.",sv
169355,A,Uh-huh.,b
169356,A,Yeah.,b
169357,B,"Or they, they have very minimum, minimal care",sv
169358,B,"and the, the care that they are getting, the people who are giving it are are paid at a minimum wage,",sv
169359,B,and they just they don't care as much.,sv
169360,A,Yeah.,b
169361,B,"And, and like you said, they're trying to make it, the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything.",sv
169362,A,Uh-huh.,b
169363,B,"That certainly would be something to, to watch for.",sv
169364,B,"Because you've got, with some of them being, some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in, .",sv
169365,A,"I know,",aa
169366,A,"and and sometimes they share a room,",sv
169367,A,"and it's just a little cubbyhole,",sv

169422,B,So they didn't have to worry about that.,sd
169423,A,"Oh, yeah.",b
169424,B,"And it was really a nice, it was really a nice compromise, especially, because she felt like she was still living in her own house.",sd

169459,A,none of them have cars because they can't drive.,sd

169464,A,like maybe Wednesday night it's George's turn to set all the tables.,sd
169465,B,Uh.,b
169466,A,"And it's really nice because that keeps them going, too, rather than just sitting around.",sd
169467,B,Yeah.,b

169475,A,just to keep them going.,sv
169476,B,Yeah.,b
169477,A,Uh-huh.,b

169480,A,Uh-huh.,aa
169481,B,"Yeah,",b

169502,B,"we really, we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of T V because we both were raised, you know, that way, you know, where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a T V to be the baby-sitter.",sd
169503,A,Uh-huh.,b
169504,A,Uh-huh.,b
169505,B,And we just don't want that.,sd
169506,B,"We want more communication and interaction, you know, amongst us as a family.",sd
169507,B,"And we both like sports,",sd

169509,A,Uh-huh.,b
169510,B,"And plus, we like, we both like to cook,",sd

169535,B,Yeah.,b
169536,A,They like that.,sd

169540,A,and when it's,%

169565,B,"and that's,",%
169566,A,Yeah.,b

169568,A,Uh-huh.,b

169592,A,"it's, um,",%
169593,A,"the, the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you we really don't have any privacy when we're at home, because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms.",sd
169594,B,Yeah.,b
169595,A,"But, um, like I say, you know, I'm twenty, I'll be twenty-two next month,",sd
169596,A,and I'm closer to the younger kids than I am the ones my own age.,sd

169600,A,and I like to spend time with them.,sd

170078,A,Right.,na
170079,B,"I don't think it's the basic,",sd
170080,B,I think it's the other one.,sd
170081,A,"The one that's like you get additional,",sv
170082,A,they'll pay a little bit more I think for the different procedures.,sd
170083,B,Uh-huh.,b
170084,B,Uh-huh.,b
170085,A,"We just have the basic right now,",sd
170086,A,and for most things it tends to cover it,sd
170087,A,"We don't too many major, um, expenses at this point,",sd
170088,A,but we have been able to find dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays.,sd
170089,A,"A couple of times we've had to pay, oh I don't know, three to five dollars but that's not that bad.",sd
170090,B,Uh-huh.,b
170091,B,"No,",aa
170092,B,that's great.,ba
170093,B,"Yeah,",b
170094,B,we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too.,sd
170095,B,Yes,b
170096,B,"and, let's see,",^h
170097,B,"besides insurance, other things that we looked at, um,",sd
170098,B,"well, my husband does not like to commute very far,",sd
170099,A,Uh-huh.,b
170100,B,"and, and we don't like him to be, you know, having to drive an hour to work or something",sd
170101,A,"No,",aa
170102,A,we don't like that either,sd
170103,B,"So we kind of looked for where, where the, uh, his office would be located",sd

170109,B,"Um, especially when they finish all the construction out here",sv
170110,A,Right.,b
170111,B,"and we didn't want him to let, you know, to,",sd
170112,B,"like we had some job offers in the New York area,",sd
170113,B,"and we thought, well, you know, he would be really commuting",sd
170114,A,"Oh, yes,",ba
170115,A,you're not kidding.,ba
170116,B,"and not only is it, you know, trouble to have to drive, but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving.",sv
170117,A,That's right.,ba
170118,B,"And, um, so, that was something that was important to us,",sd
170119,B,"and, because, like I say, we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long",sd
170120,B,"that we were anxious to do everything we could to have, you know, made us be more together,",sd
170121,B,"and, and what other,",%
170122,B,can you think of another thing that you guys looked at,qy

170124,A,"Well, those are some of the things that are very important to us too.",sd
170125,B,Uh-huh.,b

170127,A,"the athletic facilities that you sometimes take advantage of I think that's, that's pretty nice,",sd
170128,B,Uh-huh.,b

170130,A,"we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or, or any of that.",sd
170131,A,"But that's, that's a nice benefit to have.",sv

170133,B,that's true.,ba
170134,B,That's really important.,sv
170135,B,"Um, also, what, um, opportunities there would be for advancement, I think, we looked at besides just, you know, what salary you would be having now.",sd
170136,B,"But when, when could, uh, your salary increase",sd
170137,A,Right.,b
170138,B,"um, is there, was there somewhere to go.",sd
170139,A,"Yeah,",b

170143,A,I know many of us are thankful that he still has a,sd

170147,B,that's really true.,ba
170148,A,"um, if, if an employee is especially exemplary, I think it's often,",sv
170149,A,"in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say, Hey, you know, this person did a wonderful job, give him a big bonus kind of thing.",sv
170150,A,"A lot of times smaller companies have bonus plans, where I think in a large company it's hard to do that because there're just so many people to deal with",sv
170151,B,Uh-huh.,b
170152,B,Uh-huh.,b
170153,A,"and you have to have guidelines, you know, for salary increases, and things like that,",sv
170154,A,"that's one of the things that, that happens when someone, when you're dealing with a large company.",sv
170155,B,Uh-huh.,b
170156,A,But.,%
170157,B,"But, we also were interested in, um, you know, being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some opportunity for friendships that way, so that you would feel happy going to work every day and Rather than thinking Oh, I really, I can't stand these people.",sd

170162,B,"It's only been, not even a year yet,",sd

170167,A,He may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some time.,sd

170171,B,"You never know,",b^m
170172,B,we're hoping that that won't be the case,sd
170173,B,"We, I think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose, um, this area is that, um, my husband was raised in Irving",sd
170174,A,Uh-huh.,b
170175,B,"and so he, we have a lot of family here, his side of the family.",sd
170176,B,"And being,",%

170179,B,we didn't have anyone in town that was our family.,sd
170180,A,Right.,b
170181,B,"And although we had really good friends and we had church and school support and things, um, we were anxious to move close to family members, just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that.",sd
170182,A,Yeah.,b
170183,A,"We're very,",sd
170184,B,"So, that really made a big difference, I think, in why we chose T I, and chose to move this way.",sd
170185,A,"We're very far from our families,",sd
170186,A,and it's really hard.,sd
170187,A,"I have little children,",sd

170189,A,"and so, our, our families are, are really far away.",sd

170234,B,"I feel that, uh, we've missed as far as the top jobs go. You know, the higher echelon.",sv
170235,A,Yeah.,b
170236,A,Uh-huh.,b
170237,B,"Because if you look at most corporations, there isn't a woman, you know, that's on the board of directors, or that type of thing,",sv

170249,A,yeah.,aa
170250,B,"You know, it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living,",sv

170253,B,"So I think that we did come a long way in the sense that we are allowed to vote in, you know, like you say, we're out in the labor force, but I think we've lost something too.",sd

170255,A,"my mom, she's a housewife,",sd

170266,A,Yeah.,b
170267,B,"If you are not going to have a family, then that's fine,",sv

170274,B,"and I think that's why there is so many problems you know, with kids today,",sv

170278,A,"Yeah,",b

170280,A,"Yeah,",b

170283,A,"when both partners of the marriage work, she feels that that's taking more away,",sd

170288,B,they don't want to take care of the kids. And the house and that kind of thing.,sv
170289,A,Yeah.,b
170290,B,"That's very true, but then they shouldn't have a family.",sv
170291,A,Yeah.,b
170292,B,"That's what I'm saying, you know,",sd
170293,B,"I think it's great that women have a choice today. That there are ways to prevent families, you know,",sd
170294,A,Uh-huh.,b
170295,B,like basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies.,sd
170296,A,Yeah.,b
170297,B,There is no need to have children if you don't want them.,sv
170298,A,"What do you think about that,",qo
170299,A,"do you think that, uh,",qy
170300,A,what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business?,qo
170301,B,"That's fine,",sv
170302,B,"that's, that's the freedom of choice.",sv
170303,A,Uh-huh.,b
170304,B,"And I agree with that,",sd
170305,B,because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent.,sv
170306,A,Uh-huh.,b
170307,B,"Well, I shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent.",h
170308,B,They won't be a caring parent.,sv
170309,A,Uh-huh.,b
170310,B,"Like they won't have that,",sv
170311,A,Or they won't be as good as they could be.,sv
170312,B,"Right,",aa
170313,B,"that's what I mean,",aa
170314,B,they'll feel like it's a job.,sv
170315,A,Uh-huh.,b
170316,B,It's not like something that they really wanted.,sv
170317,B,"Like I had three children,",sd

170319,A,Uh-huh.,b
170320,B,"I'm not sorry I had any of them,",sd

170323,B,"You know, I had to work, but I tried to make it as painless as possible.",sd
170324,A,Uh-huh.,b
170325,B,"In fact, at one time I worked as a second shift,",sd

170328,B,and I was sitting there.,sd
170329,B,It was like I didn't belong anymore.,sd
170330,B,"And it was because I had worked for about nine months,",sd
170331,B,and when they were coming home I was going to work.,sd
170332,A,Uh-huh.,b
170333,B,"And I wasn't there at supper time or bed time,",sd
170334,B,"or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they would be coming in the door,",sd
170335,B,I would be going out.,sd
170336,A,Exactly.,aa
170337,B,"So we were,",sd
170338,B,I felt I was losing my family.,sd
170339,A,Uh-huh.,b
170340,B,"And that's why I said that's it,",sd
170341,B,"I either have to quit or, you know, try something else,",sd
170342,B,so I went on third shift.,sd
170343,A,Uh-huh.,b
170344,B,And I worked that shift for eleven years.,sd
170345,A,"Oh, my.",ba
170346,B,Yeah.,b
170347,A,Bless you,"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc"
170348,B,Just so that my kids would have me at home.,sd

170350,B,"You know, and I feel that's very important,",sv
170351,B,"it really is,",sv
170352,B,and it's too bad because mothers miss out on so much too.,sv
170353,A,Uh-huh.,b
170354,B,"So I mean in the sense that we've come a long way,",sv
170355,B,"yes,",b
170356,B,but we've sacrificed a lot to get there.,sv
170357,A,"Yeah,",aa
170358,A,"I, I agree.",aa
170359,B,"And, uh, I really think that if, uh, like after the second World War when women went to work in factories and all that, that was like out of necessity, because the men weren't here anymore.",sv
170360,A,Uh-huh.,b
170361,B,But then it got to be a point where they got some independence.,sv
170362,A,"And they just enjoyed the income, the extra.",sv
170363,B,Exactly.,aa
170364,B,"A man can afford the necessities, a woman affords the luxuries.",sv
170365,A,Uh-huh.,b
170366,B,"And I notice today kids, you know,",sd
170367,B,like we had apartments before we had homes.,sd
170368,A,Uh-huh.,b
170369,B,And we had to walk before we had a car.,sd
170370,A,Exactly.,aa
170371,B,"And now kids at sixteen years old, they have their birthday,",sv
170372,B,"what do they get,",qh
170373,B,they get a car.,sv
170374,A,"Oh, I know",ba
170375,B,"And to me, it's like we've lost our values in this country.",sd
170376,A,Uh-huh.,b
170377,B,"We really have,",sv
170378,B,"and I, I'm not trying to be, uh, you know, a prude or old fashioned or anything, but I, I don't think if you, unless you earn something and you've worked for it, and you have a sense of pride about it,",sd
170379,B,"because while I did this in, you know, no one gave it to me.",sd
170380,A,Uh-huh.,b
170381,B,"You will take better care of that,",sv
170382,B,and you will prize that possession. More than someone handing something to you.,sv
170383,A,Exactly.,aa
170384,A,Uh-huh.,b
170385,B,"And it's just like college too,",sv
170386,B,"I think that if a kid goes to college, and you can help them, fine, but I don't think you should pay the whole way.",sv
170387,A,"See, yeah,",b
170388,A,"see, now, my parents, there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college.",sd
170389,B,Of course.,aa
170390,A,"And so far there is only two of us that have gone,",sd

170393,A,I have six weeks left,sd
170394,A,"and I'll, you know, I'll graduate,",sd
170395,A,"and I paid my entire way,",sd
170396,A,"and that's the way it'll go down the line,",sd
170397,A,"and like I don't have a car because I'm paying for college,",sd
170398,A,"and if I want a car,",sd
170399,A,"my parents always said if we wanted a car, we paid for the car, and we paid for our own insurance,",sd
170400,A,and I think that's right,sd
170401,A,"because,",%
170402,B,"Sure,",b
170403,B,"but I'll bet your values are a lot higher, you know, and your self esteem and the, the way you, uh, you know, think about things is probably a lot more common sense than these kids that don't have that responsibility.",sv

171671,B,It has a stereo and a cassette player,sd

171674,A,That's incredible.,ba

171676,A,That is incredible.,ba
171677,B,So.,%
171678,A,"Uh, we, we get about, our, the van gets, on highways, can get about twenty-eight.",sd
171679,A,The Audi does not have good mileage.,sd
171680,A,That's the one drawback.,sd
171681,A,"It's a powerful car. Um, but it does not, uh,",sd
171682,B,Uh-huh.,b
171683,A,"I mean, I, if I'm on a highway and I can get twenty, twenty-one miles per gallon, I consider that I'm lucky.",sd
171684,A,"Maybe, maybe sometimes I've gotten twenty-two.",sd
171685,A,It comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving,sd
171686,B,Uh-huh.,b
171687,A,"and that's a, to me is a real drawback.",sv
171688,A,"I wish I would, you know, I could settle for twenty-eight,",sd
171689,A,"but, uh, the, uh, the frills on that car are nice, but they're not necessary, for me except air conditioning.",sd
171690,B,Uh-huh.,b
171691,A,"In this area, uh, in Washington D C area, it gets hot and humid.",sd
171692,B,"Uh-huh,",b
171693,B,it's really humid.,sd

171696,A,"Um, but I, uh, I, I don't need, uh, you know,",sd
171697,A,"power windows are nice, but I don't need them Although I must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads, come into a toll road, you just push that button down,",sd

171701,B,yeah.,b

171706,B,You don't have to stretch.,^2

171708,A,I probably could have lived a little longer,sd
171709,B,That's true.,ba

171712,A,and those are really nice in good weather.,sv
171713,B,That's right.,ba
171714,A,"So, so I guess if we get a new car, it definitely would have to have anti lock brakes,",sd

171716,B,Uh-huh.,b
171717,A,I guess that those are my major criteria.,sd
171718,A,"Everything else is, you know, a luxury,",sv
171719,A,"and they, make the car more expensive, but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong.",sv

172525,B,"So,",%
172526,A,"Um. But you still have to pay for it, though, even though they're not going to do it?",%

172529,B,"so we,",%
172530,B,"Yeah,",ny
172531,B,because it's an association fee.,sd

172543,B,"They take care of the, uh, landscape,",sd
172544,B,because we live in a cul-de-sac,sd
172545,B,and there is a island in the middle,sd
172546,A,Uh-huh.,b
172547,B,so they care of that,sd
172548,B,and there is a pool and they take care of the pool,sd
172549,A,Uh-huh.,b
172550,B,"and, and there is a pond,",sd
172551,B,they take care of the pond in the park area and that kind of thing.,sd
172552,A,Uh-huh.,b
172553,B,"And, uh, so you're basically paying, oh,",sd
172554,B,"and the sprinkler system that,",sd
172555,B,that,%
172556,B,"our yard doesn't have a sprinkler system, but the island does",sd
172557,B,"and, uh certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems",sd

172560,A,Uh-huh.,b
172561,A,Um.,%
172562,B,"So,",%
172563,A,"But you knew when you moved in, you'd have to pay that, didn't you?",qy

172565,A,Oh,b
172566,B,And that's the bad thing.,sd
172567,B,I just hope it doesn't go up any more,sd

172570,B,I don't know what to do if you can't afford it,sd
172571,A,I don't know either.,ba
172572,A,That's interesting.,ba
172573,B,"So, uh, but, they're,",%
172574,B,that's what they do.,sd
172575,B,They take care of basically the front yards and unless you don't want them to do it.,sd
172576,A,Uh-huh.,b
172577,A,Now do at a,%
172578,A,do things like plant bushes and trees?,qy
172579,B,"They,",%
172580,B,"only in, like, in the common areas and in the island.",na
172581,A,"Oh, okay.",bk
172582,B,But they don't do it in your yard.,sd
172583,A,"So, there is, like, no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that?",qy
172584,B,"Right,",na
172585,B,"uh-huh,",ny
172586,B,"yeah,",ny
172587,B,"so we've added bushes and, and shrubbery, too.",sd

172589,A,"Yeah,",b
172590,A,when we moved into our house I just hated the bushes they had.,sd
172591,A,"I, I ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back.",sd
172592,B,I know.,ba
172593,A,And put new ones out front.,sd
172594,A,But that was a lot of work.,sd
172595,B,Yeah.,b
172596,A,Took me a long time.,sd
172597,B,"Yeah,",b
172598,B,"that's what we did when we first moved in, too.",sd
172599,A,Uh-huh.,b
172600,B,Just rearranged some things,sd
172601,A,"Yeah,",b
172602,A,"and then, then we put in a sprinkler system,",sd
172603,A,"and, We won't go through that again,",sd
172604,B,Oh.,b
172605,A,I will pay someone to do it,sd
172606,B,"Oh, really?",bh
172607,A,"Oh, it took so long.",sd
172608,B,Oh.,b
172609,A,"Because my husband was, you know, digging the trenches because he didn't want to get a trencher, you know,",sd
172610,A,there is a machine that will do it.,sd
172611,B,"Oh, yeah.",b
172612,A,"Because, you know, there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it.",sd
172613,A,And I guess that costs you an absolute fortune.,sv
172614,B,Oh.,b
172615,B,"That's true,",aa

172617,B,you did it manually.,bf

172619,B,Oh.,b
172620,B,"Oh, gosh.",ba
172621,A,"Yeah,",b

172625,A,it's nice.,sd
172626,B,"Yeah,",b
172627,B,that's a good investment there.,sv
172628,A,"Yeah,",b
172629,A,"well, we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble,",sd
172630,A,"you know, you have to keep the, the area moist around the house or it makes it worse,",sd
172631,B,Oh.,b
172632,A,"so, we had an incentive there to do that.",sd
172633,B,Oh.,b
172634,A,Okay.,"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc"
172635,A,Go ahead.,ad
172636,B,"Well, uh, a friend of mine actually works for McDonald Douglas in the, uh, in the space station program",sd
172637,B,so I get to find out a lot of information about what's going on there,sd
172638,A,Oh.,b
172639,B,and  it sure sounds like that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels.,sv
172640,A,Sure.,b
172641,A,Uh-huh.,b
172642,B,"Uh, they're, they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things.",sv
172643,B,"Uh, I think one of the big things he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads.",sv
172644,B,"And that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down here on earth including, uh, some new pharmaceutical techniques.",sv
172645,A,"Oh, you're kidding.",ba
172646,A,Yeah.,b
172647,B,"So, you know, there's  there's a big opportunity for us to explore, uh, what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment.",sv
172648,A,Huh.,%
172649,A,Uh-huh.,b
172650,A,Sure.,b
172651,B,So. I suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that.,sv
172652,A,"Oh, that's good because sometimes I wonder, you know, being a, uh, lay person out there of not, uh, knowing exactly what's going on in space. Whether, you know, they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not",sd
172653,A,we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here.,sd
172654,A,"Being, you know,",%
172655,A,"to me, all this, uh, space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth. That, uh, we can't live on Mars.",sd
172656,A,"We can't live here,",sv
172657,A,we can't live there.,sv

172659,A,"I mean, there's, uh, no other resource for us to, to look at other than here.",sv
172660,A,"So, it's kind of like, to me,",%
172661,A,I would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space,sv
172662,A,"and what, you know,",%
172663,A,not that I want everything to halt,sd
172664,A,"and let's forget about the space program or whatever,",sd
172665,A,because we're always curious,sv
172666,A,and we always need to know more things.,sv
172667,A,"But, uh, to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here.",sv
172668,A,Let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here.,sv
172669,A,"Mainly because, uh,",%
172670,A,the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us.,sv
172671,A,I mean this is it.,sv
172672,A,"I mean if we would have, uh, if we would have went into space and found Mars a livable, uh, planet, we probably would have inhabited it",sv
172673,A,"and, uh, you know, who would have cared about earth?",qh
172674,A,"It would have been another planet to kind of take over and, uh, continue on.",sv
172675,A,"So, you know, and that",%
172676,A,"when I look at the space program itself, I think of it, you know, as being in terms of it's, it's interesting to learn but it's also, it's, it brings down the fact that this earth is it.",sd
172677,A,"It's it for us, you know what I mean? Uh, unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in space or whatever.",sv
172678,B,Right.,b
172679,A,"But I would love to, uh, go into the space shuttle some day and, uh, just see, uh, you know, the earth and the different planets and things like that.",sd
172680,A,"I, I think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do I don't know.",sd
172681,B,"Well, uh, as far as the practical aspects go, I suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise between, you know, deep space I'm sorry, deep space exploration and, uh, and not doing anything because we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station.",sd
172682,A,Uh-huh.,b
172683,A,Uh-huh.,b
172684,A,Sure.,b
172685,A,Exactly.,aa
172686,A,Uh-huh.,b
172687,B,"And, uh, you know, perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that, uh, we'd normally do down here that are damaging to the environment.",sd
172688,A,Uh-huh.,b
172689,A,Exactly.,aa
172690,A,"Yeah,",b
172691,A,"that's true, you know.",ba
172692,A,"And I, I think of, uh,",%
172693,A,I'm sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program that's going on currently out in the Arizona desert.,qy^d
172694,B,Uh-huh.,ny
172695,A,"Uh, there's, uh, you know, they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create, you know, an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it",sd
172696,A,"and then they have an area that's more, uh, you know, full of, uh, vegetation, tropicals, that kind of thing, to kind of look at things and say, you know, the environment wise, this is where we're living",sd

172700,A,"I don't know how many people could live up in space, uh, for any length of time",sd

172702,A,and it's cloudy for days,sd
172703,A,and we don't see the sun,sd
172704,A,"and the people, their moods are extreme, you know.",sv

172708,A,"You know, when is the sun going to come out?",qh

172716,B,I don't have a lot of time,sd

172776,A,Uh-huh.,b
172777,B,"On Saturdays they have, uh, a variety of things, uh,",sd
172778,B,and a lot of times I record it and watch it some other time.,sd

172781,A,Um.,%
172782,B,"and, um, they have a calligraphy show,",sd

172789,B,"and one of those is on, it kind of inspires me.",sd
172790,A,That sounds like a good idea.,ba
172791,A,"I notice that, um, since we moved here that we, we did get the cable T V,",sd
172792,A,"and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,",sd
172793,B,Uh-huh.,b
172794,A,and I record some.,sd
172795,A,"And then, uh, we have just totally cut down,",sd

172797,B,Yeah.,b
172798,A,And so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved.,sd
172799,B,"Yeah,",b
172800,B,"we do some of that,",sd

172802,A,Uh-huh.,b
172803,A,"Well, that's probably what I watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies",sd

172811,A,Right.,b

172818,B,the movie can be unbelievable.,^2

172820,A,right.,b
172821,A,Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something.,sd

172824,A,and it's so convenient at home,sd
172825,A,and you can do it anytime you take the notion.,sd
172826,B,Yeah.,b
172827,A,"And so, I have really enjoyed that",sd
172828,A,"but, but there are,",%
172829,A,I do have friends that watch programs,sd
172830,A,like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it.,sd

172832,B,"Uh-huh,",b
172833,B,I'm not that hung up to most things.,sd
172834,B,I mean if I miss something big deal,sd
172835,A,Yes.,b
172836,A,"Well, and things are repeated, so often that you know if, if I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show if I ever decide to tune it in again,",sv
172837,B,Yeah.,b
172838,B,That's true.,ba
172839,B,Yeah.,b
172840,B,Yeah.,b
172841,A,the only one I've ever seen and it'll be showing again.,sd
172842,A,Pretty funny.,sv
172843,B,Yeah.,b
172844,A,"But, uh, T V is something that we try to not, um, deliberately try not to get hung up on it, like you say.",sd
172845,B,Yeah.,b
172846,B,We do too.,sd
172847,B,Too many other things to do and too much going on.,sd
172848,A,Uh-huh.,b
172849,A,"And we don't want our kids to, to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your, spare time.",sd
172850,B,Right.,b
172851,B,Right.,aa
172852,B,I agree.,aa
172853,A,"So it's a little bit, something that we try doing",sd
172854,A,"and there's, there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day.",sd
172855,B,Uh-huh.,b
172856,A,"And you could say, oh, that's a good program for them because it's educational",sd
172857,A,but still you want them to go out and do other things.,sd

174635,A,Uh-huh.,b
174636,A,Uh-huh.,b
174637,B,because health care is so ridiculously expensive.,sv
174638,B,"Because we're, we're paying our own insurance right now.",sd
174639,A,"uh-huh,",b
174640,A,uh-huh.,b
174641,B,"But and I'm,",%

174644,A,"Great,",ba
174645,A,"I had, I had a granddaughter",sd
174646,B,"Oh, congratulations.",ba
174647,B,And so one thing that I'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits,sd
174648,B,because it's more important with a family,sd
174649,A,Right.,b
174650,B,"and you know, our doctor's routine doctor's visits covered,",sd

174661,B,our deductible's five hundred,sd

174663,A,Each person.,^2
174664,A,"Yeah,",aa
174665,A,"that's pretty that's pretty high,",sd
174666,B,Right,b
174667,B,"but, you know, so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick",sd
174668,A,Right.,b
174669,B,"it doesn't cover doctor's visits, things like that.",sd
174670,A,"That's, that's right.",ba

174674,B,Uh.,%
174675,A,"Yeah,",b

174680,A,and where she works she has no benefits at all.,sd
174681,B,Wow.,ba
174682,A,"And her wage is not, not very good",sd
174683,B,Uh-huh.,b
174684,A,"But it's, it's the type of area we live in.",sd
174685,A,"Of course, living expenses aren't as bad either, though, which makes a difference.",sd
174686,B,"And probably the medical care is less expensive, too.",sv

174688,B,Uh-huh.,b
174689,A,"you know, they have to pay for their own insurance.",sd
174690,A,"But, uh",%
174691,B,"So I think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there,",sd
174692,B,"and so the insurance would cost lower,",sd
174693,A,"Uh, well, from what I've seen,",sd
174694,A,"from my aunt and uncle really from Florida up to here,",sd
174695,A,they're not that much different.,sd
174696,B,"Well, I know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston",sd

174698,B,and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan.,sd

174703,A,Wow,ba
174704,A,that's a big difference.,ba
174705,B,And I was at one of the big hospitals in New York.,sd
174706,A,Uh-huh.,b
174707,B,But that's a huge difference just between,sd

174710,A,"Oh, yeah,",aa
174711,A,should be.,sv
174712,B,So I was pretty shocked at that.,sd
174713,B,"But the other thing that I'm really concerned about,",sd
174714,B,"and most companies don't have,",sd
174715,B,"some are starting to have, is day care",sd
174716,B,"because it would be really nice to be able to have, you know, someone that could watch my daughter at work.",sd

174718,B,"and if she were sick I could go down and see her, if she needs to be fed, whatever.",sd

174729,A,"I don't know how they do it,",sd

174731,A,"getting them there and then, and going to work, and then picking them up and, all the preparations.",sd
174732,B,"And, and your hours are, much more constrained and things like that.",^2
174733,A,"Uh-huh,",b
174734,A,uh-huh.,b
174735,B,"And, that, to me, well, that, you know,",%
174736,B,"those three things, the health care, vacation, and day care are probably the most important benefits.",sv
174737,A,Uh-huh.,b
174738,A,Uh-huh.,b
174739,B,"I suppose I should be concerned with life insurance and, uh, retirement plans",sd
174740,B,"but,",%
174741,A,"Oh, I don't know,",h
174742,A,"I think those benefits you mentioned, sometimes they're even more important than the wage itself.",sv
174743,B,Yeah.,b
174744,A,"If you can get those benefits even, uh,",sv
174745,A,"they, they come out to much, a much better benefit than, than an increase in your wage a lot of times.",sv
174746,B,Right,b
174747,B,"because you're, you know,",%
174748,B,"certainly something like day care at the work place would make life so much simpler that it's worth paying, you know, having a lower salary.",sv

174753,A,"Oh, yeah.",b
174754,A,"Oh, yeah,",aa
174755,A,it would make it a lot better.,sv
174756,B,because your life would be so much easier.,sv
174757,A,Uh-huh.,b
174758,B,And there's a question of quality of life also.,sv
174759,A,"Uh, well, and if it was there, you would really have a little more, uh, knowledge on what's going on probably, you know, with your child.",sv
174760,B,Yeah.,b
174761,B,"Right,",b

174764,A,Yeah.,b
174765,A,"Right,",b

174775,B,Uh-huh.,b
174776,A,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",sd
174777,B,Yeah,b
174778,B,"because Pittsburgh's a big enough city, too.",sd
174779,A,Uh-huh.,b
174780,B,"But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones. Just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and things like that.",sv
174781,A,Uh-huh.,b
174782,A,"Yeah,",b
174783,B,Because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies.,sd

179367,B,Pane.,^2
179368,B,Uh-huh.,b
179369,A,"So he had to redo them like three times before I was happy with them, before he was happy, you know, that they even looked halfway decent,",sd

179371,B,Um.,%
179372,A,"I mean, hire a professional,",sd

179374,B,"No,",aa
179375,B,"and it really,",%
179376,B,"like you said, always takes way longer than anyone, um, is able to guess, because I know my husband he, he painted, when he,",sv
179377,B,"it was just the preparation time was so long. That when he actually got down to the painting part, he, it was like ten times longer than he already thought he would be done,",sd
179378,A,Right.,b
179379,B,"and, and, uh, he did part of the, in the, at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in,",sd

179381,A,"Oh, no.",ba
179382,B,"And then we went in there, you know, one was,",sd

179385,A,"Oh, and that can make a difference, too.",sv

179389,A,"and you've got like maybe, five hundred,",sd
179390,A,"well that's an exaggeration,",sd

179406,A,"but, you know, we worked something out, because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long.",sd
179407,A,"He really came over here to paint, I think, because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house",sd

179416,B,"we just had brick on like as accent on a certain area of our home growing up,",sd
179417,A,Uh-huh.,b

179428,A,For sure.,ba
179429,B,"I, I don't know that",%
179430,B,"like, uh, say, we're freshly graduated from school and things,",sd

179468,B,"But they came in, and, um, they came in and did it and left in just no time at all,",sd

183378,A,Uh-huh.,b

183406,B,They say like only one in ten are reported.,sd
183407,B,I believe it.,sv
183408,A,Uh-huh.,b
183409,B,That's awful.,ba
183410,B,So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it.,sv
183411,B,I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing.,sd
183412,B,"But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, you know, for people to report it.",sv
183413,A,Uh-huh.,b
183414,B,So that's probably something else they could do.,sv
183415,A,Yeah.,b
183416,B,"I don't know,",h
183417,B,"it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs, you know.",sv

183419,B,"it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, you know,",sd
183420,B,because these kids are saying why should I go to high school,sv
183421,B,"and so I can go out and work at Burger King, you know, for four dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs.",^q
183422,B,So that's certainly a big problem.,sv
183423,B,I don't know what the solution to that is.,sv
183424,B,Having more drug treatment centers available.,sv
183425,B,"Jeez, I don't know.",h
183426,A,"Uh. See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything.",sv
183427,B,Yeah.,b
183428,A,I know a lot of people that partake in that.,sd
183429,A,"And I'm not saying they're bad people,",sd
183430,A,"but I, I, I would say that's a bigger problem.",sv
183431,B,Yeah.,b
183432,B,"Because it ends up,",%
183433,B,"even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, you know,",sv

183435,A,Uh-huh.,b

183438,B,"I mean, just, oh,",%
183439,B,"gosh, horrible stuff like that.",sv

183854,A,"See, I think we might have to do that",sd
183855,A,"Of course, she looks at what she brings home each week.",sd

185195,B,"Uh, I'm not sure I, I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs",sv

185217,B,"It is interesting though,",sv
185218,B,it becomes a little of personality.,sv
185219,B,"In fact, the, the guy that was on, the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, oh, long time ago, twenty years or so, even longer than that. Twenty-one, twenty-three years ago or so, twenty-four, anyway long time ago",sv
185220,A,Uh-huh.,b

185224,A,Uh-huh.,b

185230,A,Their job.,^2
185231,A,That's true.,ba

185275,A,"I think they were expecting to find, uh, like the national average at T I.",sd
185276,A,And I think it was tremendously down.,sd
185277,B,"As far as the number of drug users, you mean?",qy
185278,A,Yeah,ny
185279,B,Huh.,b
185280,A,as far as the number of people they actually found that were drug users.,sd
185281,A,"But I think that on when I was at T I of course, we had all the information before they started.",sd
185282,B,Right.,b
185283,A,And they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs.,sd
185284,A,"And I think that's what helps, you know, that in the warning that you have a drug program, the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs, actually go",sv
185285,A,and then usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything.,sv
185286,B,"Right,",b
185287,B,"yeah,",b
185288,B,so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee.,sv
185289,A,"Yeah,",b
185290,A,and our numbers have been way down.,sd
185291,A,I don't know what they were.,sd
185292,B,"When I worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person,",sd
185293,B,"and so we had,",%
185294,B,"when we sent temporaries to T I, we had to have their drug tested.",sd
185295,A,Yeah.,b
185296,B,"And we did have a couple of cases where we really, the person said that they hadn't used anything,",sd
185297,B,"and their test came back positive,",sd
185298,B,and normally we didn't retest them.,sd
185299,B,But there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth,sd
185300,B,"and we retested them like the next day,",sd
185301,B,and they came back negative the second time.,sd
185302,A,"Oh, really.",b
185303,B,"So that, that's the only thing, I think, that might be a little bit of a problem.",sv
185304,A,"Oh, you're,",%
185305,A,"that's a good point,",sv
185306,A,"but at T I they, before they had the testing, I've forgotten, seems like it's a year ago September, something like that, they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government.",sd
185307,A,"And, of course, that's critical, just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to be, you know, have a lot of quality control, that they keep track of everything.",sd
185308,A,They don't make mistakes.,sd
185309,A,That would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive,sv
185310,B,Right.,b
185311,A,and they were not.,sd
185312,A,"And I haven't heard of any,",sd
185313,A,now I'm not in personnel or anything.,sd
185314,B,Yeah.,b
185315,A,"But, uh, they say that there, it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not.",sd
185316,A,"In other words, there's very few mistakes,",sd
185317,A,"and that, of course, has got to be critical.",sd
185318,A,"It's got to be, if you have a drug testing program,",sv
185319,A,"it's got to be with a very, very good agency.",sv
185320,A,You don't just have some local group do it.,sv
185321,A,It's got to be a highly qualified agency.,sv
185322,B,"Right,",b
185323,B,"yeah,",b
185324,B,not just some doctor's office somewhere.,sd
185325,A,"No,",aa
185326,A,you don't want to do that.,sv
185327,A,It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check.,sv
185328,A,And I think that T I is latched themselves up with an established group.,sd
185329,A,"And that would be good for any company that does it, and not to have just a very casual thing.",sv
185330,A,"It's got to be with a, you know, first class, totally independent agency. Not local of course.",sv
185331,A,"Ours, I think, well I think it was in the south somewhere,",sv
185332,A,"but it wasn't even in Dallas, you know, the one that did us.",sd
185333,B,Oh really.,b
185334,A,Yeah.,aa
185335,B,"Huh. Do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive,",qy
185336,B,or do they fire them right away.,qrr
185337,A,"Oh, no.",nn
185338,A,They're not fired.,sd
185339,A,"They are, they have one chance to then go in a program.",sd
185340,A,"You come back positive, you have one chance to go in, and go into, they have a lot of, uh, rehabilitation, both for alcohol and for drug use,",sd
185341,A,"and they have, uh, a lot of, uh, they have an agency where you can go for personal problems, financial or whatever.",sd
185342,B,Right.,b
185343,A,"And so they, they, they don't,",sd
185344,A,"no,",nn
185345,A,it's not firing first.,sd
185346,A,"It's, uh, definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate.",sd
185347,A,"In fact, again, before you go, you know, that's why I said, when they first started it, they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs, go ahead and get rehabilitated first,",sd
185348,A,and they won't say anything about it.,sd

185361,A,"I always worry about the, the classical thing that you see on T V, where the drug pushers give it to the kids for free, you know, and get them sucked in,",sd

185363,A,You know the classical thing is to give it away.,sd
185364,B,Right.,b
185365,A,I always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party,sd

185413,B,"If you're not too sure what's going on, he tells parents all the time, haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked.",sd

185420,B,"yeah,",b
185421,B,I think that's a really good thing to encourage.,sv

185431,A,"And we have one, of course, I say, in college driving. And one going to drive this summer,",sd
185432,A,"so kids are, cost you practically nothing, because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything.",sd
185433,A,"But you wait until they go and get a car, insurance, that's when they get expensive.",sd
185434,A,"As they get older you know, they cost practically nothing from one to five,",sd
185435,B,Yeah.,b

185475,A,"Well, Wayne, I've never done any, uh, auto repairs myself at all.",sd
185476,B,Uh-huh.,b
185477,A,"I mean, I may have screwed in a little screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something",sd
185478,A,"but, uh, I personally haven't done anything.",sd
185479,A,"Maybe I've, uh, changed wiper blades or something",sd
185480,A,"but I have noticed since, uh, I got married that my husband, he hates to do auto repairs,",sd
185481,A,"but he would rather do them himself than, than to pay someone else.",sd
185482,A,"I guess, he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows, he knows how to do it,",sd
185483,A,and he'll do it.,sd
185484,A,"So, he, he hates the time that he takes,",sd
185485,A,"but he has changed, um, the brakes",sd
185486,A,and he has done all of the tune-ups,sd
185487,A,and the like that,sd
185488,A,and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car.,sd
185489,A,I was really impressed with that,sd
185490,A,"We had to have it to get the car inspected,",sd
185491,A,it wouldn't pass inspection,sd
185492,A,"and, and so, he priced around",sd
185493,A,and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it,sd
185494,A,"so, he thought, well, I can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars, which he did",sd
185495,A,"and then, he did it",sd
185496,A,"and, so, I guess, uh, he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up,",sd
185497,A,"what, uh, what's your experience been like?",qo
185498,B,"Well, I, uh, I have a long experience with cars.",sd
185499,B,"I, uh, when I was younger, uh, my brother had a Corvette",sd
185500,B,and I bought a Corvette,sd
185501,B,and when you have a Corvette you more or less do all the work,sd
185502,B,"and I've done everything from build the motor from the, uh, you know, the bare block on up.",sd
185503,B,"And, I, I'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car, I hate to go pay somebody good money, you know,",sd
185504,B,I hate to pay somebody twenty-five dollars on hour for something I can do myself.,sd
185505,A,Uh-huh.,b
185506,B,"It just, to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that.",sv
185507,A,Right.,b
185508,B,"In fact, I, um, just this past weekend put new plugs in both, uh, my car an my wife's car.",sd
185509,A,Uh-huh.,b
185510,B,"And so, I, uh, I pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything I can do myself",sd
185511,B,"but I've, I've gotten to the point in my life, um, you know, I just crept over forty years old, where I don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore",sd
185512,A,That makes sense.,ba
185513,B,"I mean it's, um, I don't know whether I've, I've just reached a point, you know,",sd
185514,B,"it's, it's real rough in the winter time.",sd
185515,A,"Huh, yes.",b
185516,B,"And, uh, so, I try to make sure that, uh, by the time fall runs around, because we actually have winters here on the east coast, um, that, uh, I have, you know, the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter",sd
185517,A,Right,b
185518,B,"and, uh, then springtime I usually end up giving them, the, uh, a tune-up and make sure that they're running well,",sd
185519,B,"and, uh, you know, it's like I had the muffler go out on my, on my car, shortly before it was required to go,",sd
185520,B,"in Maryland they have, uh, emission tests.",sd
185521,A,Uh-huh.,b
185522,B,"And you're required to get your car and go through the emission test,",sd
185523,B,"well, my muffler, of course, starting going bad right before I was supposed to go to the emission test,",sd
185524,B,"so. You know, I had to do that job,",sd
185525,B,"and of course, that was back in December when it's nice and cold outside",sd
185526,A,"Yes,",b
185527,A,I'm sure it was.,ba
185528,B,"But the thing was that I could do the job myself,",sd
185529,B,"I mean, the parts cost me, oh, roughly a hundred dollars.",sd
185530,A,Uh-huh.,b
185531,B,"Um, if I'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty-five.",sd
185532,A,Right.,b
185533,B,Now like who's got that extra two and a quarter,qh
185534,B,I know I don't.,sd
185535,A,Yeah.,b
185536,A,"Well, that's exactly the way he feels is that, he really hates to spend the time,",sd
185537,A,it takes a lot of time,sd
185538,A,"if he, if he thinks it's going to be two hours, it's four if, you know, whatever, it always takes him twice as long.",sd
185539,A,"But then when he's finished he's, he always says, well, now you owe me three hundred dollars",sd
185540,A,"And then he thinks that he has the money that, that he can spend on something",sd
185541,A,and he hasn't given it to someone else.,sd
185542,B,Yeah.,b
185543,A,"So, he gets some satisfaction out of that although, generally I think he, he does not look forward to or anticipate,",sd
185544,A,there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars.,sd
185545,A,There's a lot of people,sd
185546,A,and he just isn't one of them.,sd
185547,B,Yeah.,b
185548,B,"I, uh, I don't mind it,",sd
185549,B,"um, there was a time when I had my Corvette,",sd
185550,B,"I mean, of course, I loved it, um,",sd
185551,B,"but if, you know,",%
185552,B,I've got other interests now,sd
185553,B,"and there's a lot, other more important things I think I should be doing with my time.",sd
185554,B,"And I have the same problem,",sd
185555,B,"I mean, you can tell him from me",ad
185556,B,"but it doesn't matter,",sd
185557,B,"I mean, I've, I've had greasy fingernails for years",sd
185558,B,"And it still takes me twice as long as I think it's going to take to do the job,",sd
185559,A,Yeah.,b
185560,B,"so, but, I think the difference is that, uh, when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing,",sd
185561,A,Uh-huh.,b
185562,B,"and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right,",sd
185563,B,"and, you know, I've, I've in the past I've had brake jobs done by someone that when I went back and looked at it some months later I'd find something drastically wrong with it, you know, like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident. You know, those kind of things,",sd
185564,A,Right.,b
185565,A,Right.,b
185566,B,"and when you have a vehicle that's being used by, you know, other members of your family, you know, you don't want that kind of a situation to come up.",sd
185567,A,No.,b
185568,B,"And it's very, very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust.",sv
185569,B,I only have one guy that I know that I trust to work on my car.,sd
185570,A,Uh-huh.,b
185571,B,"And, uh, he's about sixty miles from here.",sd
185572,B,"And so, it,",%
185573,B,"and if I have something that's really major that I can't handle or feel I don't have the time to handle, I'll take it to him to do it.",sd
185574,A,"Right,",b
185575,A,"you know, that it's, uh , really has a bad reputation is to feel that, that people in general feel and have, have rightly so, I think been cheated many times,",sd
185576,A,"and, um, and well, I know once when we had a,",sd
185577,A,we usually inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car,sd
185578,A,"but, um, once the muffler needed to be changed",sd
185579,A,"and, uh, he had looked at him himself",sd
185580,A,"and, but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change",sd
185581,A,"he said, that's really, really good",sd
185582,A,"so, he went in",sd
185583,A,"and, uh, but when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something.",sd
185584,A,"Anyway, but the car that the muffler people had, um, my, at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further, you know,",sd
185585,A,"they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever,",sd
185586,B,Uh-huh.,b
185587,A,"and so, since then, I don't think he's ever even seriously considered a, you know, any kind of job he thought he could do himself.",sd
185588,A,"But, I know from his childhood, he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment, I guess.",sd
185589,A,"And, um, so, Kelly growing up, he, he felt like that, that was a good way on Saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father.",sd
185590,B,Uh-huh.,b
185591,A,"And so, he used, they used car repairs kind of as a way to have a, you know, something that they did together,",sd
185592,B,Uh-huh.,b
185593,B,Yeah.,b
185594,A,"and he thought that turned out pretty good because it, you know, it helped him to understand and be functional now,",sd
185595,A,"and it helped him to have a close relationship,",sd
185596,A,"so, that's one, one way he looked at it.",sd
185597,B,Yeah.,b
185598,B,"that's probably, uh, uh, something that, uh, is, is you know, is good for both of them.",sd
185599,B,"I know that, uh, my older son I could never get him interested in cars",sd
185600,B,"and I couldn't, you know,",sd
185601,B,"I just like, you know,",sd
185602,B,"you sure you're a boy,",^q
185603,B,"I mean, your not interested in cars,",^q
185604,A,Uh-huh.,b
185605,B,"I mean he, he just would not have anything to do with them.",sd
185606,B,"And, uh, later on and like when he, you know, grew up, got out of the house, got his own car, um, he didn't know how to do anything to it. I mean, absolutely nothing.",sd
185607,B,"I mean, he couldn't even check the oil.",sd
185608,B,"I mean, that's, that's how uninformed he was and disinterested.",sd
185609,A,Uh-huh.,b
185610,B,"And, I guess there are some people out there like that, um, you know,",sd
185611,B,"I always thought maybe, you know, if he took more of an interest and, you know, what I was doing",sd
185612,B,and maybe we could have communicated better.,sd
185613,A,Uh-huh.,b
185614,B,"But, uh, yeah,",b

185616,A,"Yeah,",b
185617,A,it didn't always work.,sd
185618,A,"Well, I felt, um, I feel like I could myself, do some things but, that I have enough responsibility that if I have someone like my father when I was living at home, and my husband, that's willing to do it, I go ahead and let them do it.",sd
185619,A,"I don't feel the need to, um, you know, be a feminist on that issue and say I can take care of my own things.",sd
185620,A,"I'm, I'm happy to let them run the cars because I have so, many other responsibilities that, um,",sd

185622,B,"Uh, I trained my, uh, my wife in the in, in doing things,",sd
185623,B,"in fact, uh, when I, uh, first transferred down to, uh, Texas Instruments back in nineteen eighty-seven, um, uh, when I left here, uh, she had to change a set of plugs on the car because she was up here for a month or so, after I was",sd

185629,A,"It's a good experience,",ba

187100,B,"Although they're tending to try to really cut costs more and more. Um, what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to, um, set hospitals in the area.",sd
187101,B,They call it network hospitals.,sd
187102,B,They're,sd
187103,A,"Oh, yeah,",b
187104,A,I've heard of that.,sd
187105,B,"Yeah,",b
187106,B,"they're hospitals that they're, uh, agreeing with, uh, T I that they'll be a certain rate, you know, for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep you know, costs down.",sd
187107,A,Uh-huh.,b
187108,B,Now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors.,sd
187109,B,"So it's almost like a, um, uh, an H M O you know, kind of thing that, uh, only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage.",sd
187110,A,Yeah.,b
187111,B,If you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get.,sd
187112,A,Uh-huh.,b
187113,B,"We have some dental coverage now, um,",sd
187114,B,but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile.,sd
187115,B,"Like, I've had a couple of crowns recently",sd
187116,B,"and if you didn't have the extra dental plus, um, you only get like a third of your cost, which can be kind of expensive with a crown.",sd
187117,A,Yeah,b
187118,A,it can .,ba
187119,B,"So, I, I pay,",%
187120,B,"yeah,",%
187121,B,"I pay for the extra dental plus, so much more per month because it always seems like if you're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more.",sd
187122,A,Uh-huh.,b
187123,B,"Um, we do have pension, although I've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good",sd
187124,B,and I know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that,sd
187125,A,"Oh, I like to think about that.",ad
187126,B,"After you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go, is that all that's in there.",sv
187127,B,I don't think's it's going to pay too long when I get out.,sd
187128,B,"Um, we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago, um,",sd
187129,B,"it's not an I R A,",sd
187130,B,it's called a four oh one K plan.,sd
187131,B,It's kind of like pension.,sd
187132,B,You put in so much money,sd
187133,B,"and then, T I, um, meets you half way up to a certain maximum.",sd
187134,B,"So like I put in a dollar, they put in fifty cents.",sd
187135,A,Uh-huh.,b
187136,B,"So, that grows pretty good",sd
187137,B,and I think that will be more of something I can see of a pension than the regular pension plan.,sd
187138,A,Uh-huh.,b
187139,B,"Of course you can buy stock in the company,",sd
187140,B,"but, you know, that's not always a real, for sure kind of thing.",sv

187142,B,"Yeah,",aa
187143,B,"especially with this one, you know, it kind of goes up and down.",sv
187144,B,"I don't know if it's any different than other companies,",sd
187145,B,but you hate to have it fluctuate,sv
187146,B,"and like, you know, last year it was forty dollars a share",sd
187147,B,"and now this year it's thirty six dollars a share,",sd
187148,B,"and you go, gee, I'm losing money",sd
187149,B,Doesn't quite feel as good.,sv
187150,A,Yeah.,b
187151,B,"And we you know, vacation normally after you're here for six months",sd
187152,B,and you start to get like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you.,sd
187153,B,"And it's, one nice thing about T I is after you've been here, uh, for five years,  you get three weeks.",sd
187154,A,Uh-huh.,b

187158,A,Uh-huh.,b
187159,B,"And we get some, we get, uh, decent holidays.",sd

187174,A,"So the, the dental was very important, you know, to my dad.",sd
187175,B,Uh-huh.,b
187176,A,"But, um, I think they took the dental away now.",sd
187177,A,"He worked for United Telephone System,",sd

187179,B,Um.,b
187180,B,Uh-huh.,b
187181,A,"And they took the dental away,",sd

187186,B,"I think, uh, um,",%
187187,B,I don't use the services,sd

187189,B,"You get discounts on, uh, glasses",sd
187190,B,"and I'm not quite sure, there's certain places you can go to that have, uh, discounts for people that work here.",sd
187191,A,Uh-huh.,b
187192,B,So you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that.,sd
187193,A,"Yeah,",b
187194,A,"and now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock.  he's on that same kind of pension as what you said only,  for everything he puts in they'll match it, up to a certain amount.",sd
187195,B,Yeah,b
187196,A,"Like if he puts in a dollar they'll put in a dollar, you know.",sd
187197,B,Yeah.,b
187198,A,"And then he's only allowed, I think, I don't know if it's maybe five percent, or something like that that he's allowed to put in",sd
187199,A,and they'll match it.,sd

187230,A,"and with his doctors and stuff, they have, um, a list of doctors that the employees can go to",sd

187233,B,okay.,b
187234,A,"You know, and I think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any.",sd

187236,A,but still that works out really nice.,sd
187237,A,"You know, it,",%
187238,B,"Yeah,",b
187239,B,"we're doing an H M O right now, um,",sd
187240,B,"and when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars,",sd
187241,B,"but,  you know, sometime, sometimes when you go, you know, the prescription,",sd

187245,B,that's like a buck a capsule.,sd
187246,A,Uh-huh.,b
187247,B,So if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty-four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings.,sd
187248,B,"Then there's other times that, you know, maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than like seven or eight dollars",sd
187249,B,and you pay five anyhow.,sd

191448,A,Right,aa
191449,A,"the  health insurance I have is Met Life,",sd
191450,B,"Yeah,",b
191451,A,"and, if,",%
191452,A,"it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then, uh, you just pay ten dollars",sd
191453,A,"and then, uh, the insurance pays the rest of the bill.",sd
191454,A,"Or if you go outside you get, uh, seventy thirty.",sd
191455,B,"Now we,",%
191456,B,I have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered,sd
191457,B,"but what I found recently is what they've been doing is they, they poll somehow the area,",sd
191458,B,and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code.,sd
191459,A,Uh-huh.,b
191460,B,"And so recently, when, when we had a claim, um, they didn't pay the eighty-five percent they paid much lower",sd
191461,B,"and when I called they said, Oh well, that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area.",sd
191462,B,"And I was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code, so that, you know, two doctors could balance each other out, or their, you know, their statistics aren't very accurate. *listen",sd
191463,A,Right.,b
191464,A,"And, and they're probably doing it to their benefit, anyway.",sv

191467,B,"I would assume that you know, whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in.",sv

191475,A,"Yeah,",ny
191476,A,"yeah,",ny
191477,A,but everybody gets vacation.,ar
191478,A,"I mean, like, uh, T I and some other places, you know, they have recreational facilities,",sd
191479,A,and they have a driving range and weight room,sd
191480,A,"and, you know, I think they even have a swimming pool",sv
191481,B,Huh.,b
191482,A,and I don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that.,sd
191483,B,"Yeah,",b
191484,B,"I'm not familiar with that sort of thing,",sd
191485,B,"but you know, to me vacation is, is an issue,",sd
191486,B,"and I mean, different places have different amounts of vacation, I would assume.",sv
191487,A,Right.,b
191488,B,"And, um, you know, the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay, perhaps or, um, I don't know, I suppose, um, sick days.",sd
191489,B,Some places count the number of hours,sv
191490,B,and some places just sort of believe you.,sv
191491,A,Uh-huh.,b
191492,B,"Um, ours is based on number of days,",sd
191493,B,"and, you know, people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill.",sd
191494,A,Right.,b
191495,B,Right.,b
191496,B,"But, um, otherwise, I'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here",sd
191497,B,So maybe that covers the topic then.,sv
191498,A,Yeah.,b
191499,A,"Well, I don't know, the the working conditions, you know, if you could include that in benefits.",sv
191500,A,Some places aren't very safe to work.,sv
191501,B,Uh-huh.,b
191502,A,"And, and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you, that you have to work under.",sv
191503,B,Uh-huh.,b
191504,B,"Or maybe a uh, not really a benefit, either, but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls.",sv
191505,A,"Right,",b
191506,A,uh-huh.,b
191507,B,"Um, but, you know I suppose some places are, are more stringent about that than others.",sv
191508,A,"Yeah,",aa
191509,A,I think so.,sv
191510,B,"And, and, maybe arriving late or something like that, you know,",sv
191511,B,"how, how they enforce the rules.",sv
191512,A,Uh-huh,b
191513,B,"But other than that I don't have much feeling for, for the benefits,",sd
191514,B,"since, like I said, um, I don't have a big problem with, with them.",sd
191515,A,"Um, workmen's comp is a big thing now in, in Texas because, um, um, how much it costs the employers",sd
191516,B,Uh-huh.,b
191517,A,"and a, a lot of them are going to their own insurance now.",sd
191518,A,"And it reduces some of the length of the benefits, and, uh, and I don't know besides that.",sd
191519,A,"But I, I noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing.",sd
191520,B,"Oh I, I didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation.",sd
191521,A,"Well, well, they still have to pay it",sd
191522,A,but they buy their own instead of going through the state.,sd
191523,B,"Oh, I see.",bk
191524,A,So apparently it costs less that way.,sd
191525,B,"Uh-huh,",b
191526,B,uh-huh.,b
191527,B,"I suppose that whenever companies can avoid, um, benefits, it's to the, to, to the benefit of the company",sv
191528,A,Uh-huh.,b
191529,B,"and at least, you know, financially in the short run,",sv
191530,B,but I would think they would get a much greater turnover,sv

191532,A,Yeah.,aa
191533,A,"That's what I, what I think",sd
191534,A,"they should be able, they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are",sv
191535,A,and how much profit they're making,sv
191536,A,instead of trying to cut everything down *listen,sv
191537,A,"and then have everybody be unhappy and, and have a constant turnover of people.",sv

191888,A,"I think it's mostly concentrated toward the borders,",sv

191890,A,"the immigration is tied in with, uh, drug trafficking.",sd

191904,A,Uh-huh.,b
191905,B,"That certainly was interesting,",sv
191906,B,"since all of us had, uh, ancestors that came over that way.",sd
191907,B,"Or not all,",sd

191917,B,"Oh, yeah,",aa
191918,B,those were laws are unusual.,sv
191919,A,"Yeah,",b
191920,A,and then they'll ship the parents back,sd

191927,B,that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all that you would do it that way.,sv
191928,A,Right.,b
191929,A,Uh-huh.,b
191930,B,"You would think they could at least get a, a, a visa or something until they, uh, get citizenship.",sv
191931,B,I'm sure they want to.,sv
191932,A,"Yeah,",b
191933,A,"and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove, when was that, it was in the eighties some time if they could prove they'd been here five years.",sd

191947,B,What the controls are.,sd

191967,A,Yeah,b
191968,B,"Yeah,",%
