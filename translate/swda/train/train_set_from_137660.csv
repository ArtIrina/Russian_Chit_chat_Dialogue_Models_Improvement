138608,138608,B,Yeah.,b
138609,138609,A,"And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too.",sv
138610,138610,B,Yeah.,b
138611,138611,A,It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up.,sv

138616,138616,B,"But it's hard to find, uh, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, you know, because like I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes",sd
138617,138617,B,and I don't know if that would work for me because I don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain.,sd

138622,138622,A,"You have to,",sv

138625,138625,A,"And you can use what ever rationale you want,",sv

138627,138627,B,Right.,aa
138628,138628,A,"And, uh, you know, if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, well, then I'll around a lot longer,",sv

138641,138641,B,"If you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, you know, cause those are risk factors,",sd

138644,138644,A,"Oh, I've done a lot of study over the years",sd
138645,138645,A,and I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water.,sd

155699,155699,A,"Number two I think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would, would be dried up",sv
155700,155700,A,"and really no one would be, would only answer to, to the government to a big bureaucratic mess.",sv
155701,155701,A,"And, uh, I've seen what it has done in other countries",sd
155702,155702,A,"and so I don't think, uh, I don't think we should head in that direction.",sv

155704,155704,A,and I do agree that they exist,aa
155705,155705,A,"because health care insurance for, for everyone is skyrocketing",sv

155709,155709,B,"Well, I agree that it's a big task,",aa

155711,155711,A,Uh-huh.,b
155712,155712,B,"And possibly, just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing,",sv

155716,155716,A,Okay.,bk

155722,155722,A,"What you're  Yeah,",%
155723,155723,A,"so what you're  saying though, is instead of having the national government, uh, government administer, giving health insurance to every man, woman and child with, throughout the whole company, you see more of them as regulating the high costs, uh, that people are forced to pay for it right now.",bf

155730,155730,B,"And, uh",%
155731,155731,A,"Well, with the, with the costs as they are right now, do you think that the government, uh,",qy
155732,155732,A,"because what that would require is for us to pay, uh, more taxes",sv
155733,155733,A,"and the, the the people that can afford taxes, the middle income and the upper income will be paying more taxes to, to pay for health insurance for everyone, whereas right now the, the public themselves get health insurance",sv
155734,155734,B,Right.,b
155735,155735,A,and they provide their own health insurance.,sv
155736,155736,B,"The, well, as it is now, the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance",sv
155737,155737,B,and so that the other people have no health insurance,sv
155738,155738,B,"and, you know, they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies",sv
155739,155739,B,and somebody winds up paying for that,sv
155740,155740,B,and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance,sv

155749,155749,B,Uh-huh.,b
155750,155750,A,"and, uh, the, the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and, and, uh, don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business, whereas the federal government if they took over everything, they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business.",sv
155751,155751,A,"People would still have to pay taxes,",sv

157271,157271,A,Uh-huh,b

157282,157282,B,Okay.,b
157283,157283,A,"And, um, I do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a, a hundred thousand dollars.",sd
157284,157284,A,So they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars,sd
157285,157285,A,"and I think that's kind of why they, they were making the riskier loans,",sv
157286,157286,A,"because they were like oh, well, we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it.",sv
157287,157287,B,"Well, they didn't, they didn't have a since of risk.",qy^d

157290,157290,B,"Oh, okay.",bk
157291,157291,A,"And, uh, plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in, any, almost any type of loan",sd
157292,157292,A,"and like some banks, you know, they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make.",sd
157293,157293,B,Uh-huh.,b
157294,157294,A,And I think the S and L were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make.,sd
157295,157295,B,Okay.,bk
157296,157296,A,"And I think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve, then I don't think this would have happened.",sv

157347,157347,A,Oh.,b

157356,157356,A,as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to have something.,sv

157358,157358,A,Uh-huh.,aa
157359,157359,A,Right.,aa

157361,157361,A,Uh-huh.,aa
157362,157362,B,"And that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands I guess of, Of dollars being protected.",bf

157366,157366,B,"if, if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred billion dollars",sd
157367,157367,B,and we're taking about monies way in access of that now,sd

157369,157369,A,Uh-huh.,b

157376,157376,B,Someone whose got accounts in thirty-five different S and Ls or thirty or forty thousand dollars,%
157377,157377,B,and they're all protected by the government.,sv

157387,157387,B,it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive,sv

157389,157389,A,I think it'll happen again,aa
157390,157390,A,but I think it will be a long time in the future before it does happen again.,sv
157391,157391,A,Because I think like the bank people in any kind of people like that are going to be worry enough not to let it happen again in the near future.,sv
157392,157392,A,But I think later on they're going to start and forget about and start making the riskier loans,sv

157450,157450,B,"and that it's mostly sales tax,",sv

157473,157473,A,Right.,b

157485,157485,A,"so, so many taxes will be deducted from it",sv

169310,169310,B,"I, this, this one area is a bit more expensive,",sd

169314,169314,B,"Like you're saying,",sd

169316,169316,A,Yeah.,b
169317,169317,B,"and some of them sponsor different crafts,",sd

169323,169323,A,Yeah,b

169326,169326,A,Uh-huh.,b

169349,169349,B,"Yeah,",b

169353,169353,B,perhaps they never had children,sv

169363,169363,B,"That certainly would be something to, to watch for.",sv

185305,185305,A,"that's a good point,",sv
185306,185306,A,"but at T I they, before they had the testing, I've forgotten, seems like it's a year ago September, something like that, they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government.",sd
185307,185307,A,"And, of course, that's critical, just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to be, you know, have a lot of quality control, that they keep track of everything.",sd
185308,185308,A,They don't make mistakes.,sd

185327,185327,A,It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check.,sv
185328,185328,A,And I think that T I is latched themselves up with an established group.,sd
