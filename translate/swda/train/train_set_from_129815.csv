130415,B,I think it was Saint Augustine that we had.,sd
130416,B,"It had held onto a small portion,",sd

131060,B,It sounds wonderful.,sv

131062,A,"It's, it has four, uh, four threads instead of, the, the regular basic two threads.",sd
131063,B,"Oh, okay.",bk
131064,A,"And, uh, it,",%

131069,A,"you, you can either use three or four of the threads.",sd
131070,B,"Oh, okay.",bk
131071,A,"Uh, it's kind of, it the stitch is kind of like a knitting machine, like the, they're loopers under the bottom",sd
131072,A,"and then the, there's a seam stitch",sd
131073,A,"and it's the loopers that form the, the edge, you know that edge finish.",sd
131074,B,Uh-huh.,b
131075,A,"And, uh, that's what really makes it look professional.",sd
131076,A,You can do a lot with the Serger though.,sd

131078,A,"and, uh, you can use all kinds of different, uh, textures of thread.",sd
131079,B,So it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do.,bf

131095,B,"Oh, okay.",bk
131096,A,"You know, you can't do top stitching,",sd

131108,A,"Yeah,",b
131109,A,"I mean, we're, we're taxed on taxes",sd

131112,A,but eventually they may try to push it through.,sd
131113,B,Oh really.,b

131119,A,Uh-huh.,b
131120,B,"I mean, you know, like I say, I'm in New York",sd
131121,B,and we have a state tax as well.,sd
131122,B,So that just cuts even more.,sd
131123,A,"Yeah,",aa
131124,A,I think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits.,sv
131125,B,"Right,",aa
131126,B,"I, I think that I,",sv

131129,A,Right.,b
131130,A,Yeah.,aa
131131,B,"but given that it, that it's not spent properly, I think it's a major problem.",sv

131136,B,"what winds up happening is, for instance having kids, you know, they wind up having kids as a deduction",sv
131137,B,"and after, but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something.",sv
131138,A,Uh-huh.,b
131139,B,I think,%

131142,B,"They just don't, they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing.",sv
131143,A,Well they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well.,sv
131144,B,Right.,b
131145,A,"And, uh, I think the only way that can be changed for us to get a, a better tax revenue that's fairness and all, is for us to limit their terms.",sv

131665,B,"They needed, uh, at least at first,  they needed a smaller setting that, that was more like family where they could get one-on-one,  from, from teachers, professors and so forth, and then after a year or two move on to a little bit bigger pond where, where, when they had a little more self-confidence built up, oh, yes, I can do this, oh, I've done this before, it's just in a bigger setting,",sd

132797,B,yeah.,%
132798,A,Yeah.,b
132799,B,"Well, that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer,",sd

132801,A,Uh-huh.,b
132802,B,We need to just put external cards in,sd
132803,B,and it wouldn't do that,sd
132804,B,"so he brought it back to them,",sd
132805,B,and they're supposed to modify it.,sd

132807,B,We can't use it.,^q
132808,A,Uh-huh.,b
132809,B,"And then they said, well then don't pay it.",sd
132810,B,"And then a month later, I had to dispute it in writing,",sd
132811,B,"and I was out of the country and got back,",sd
132812,B,and I took care of it as as soon as we got the computer back,sd
132813,B,and it was okay.,sd
132814,B,I mailed off a check,sd
132815,B,but then it was too late.,sd
132816,B,So now they're hitting me up there with a finance charge.,sd
132817,A,Oh,b
132818,B,"But it's sort of, you know,",sd
132819,B,"it's, it's half our fault.",sd

132826,B,"if I had filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually, it would have been okay.",sd
132827,A,Yeah.,b
132828,B,So I learned that for the next time.,sd
132829,A,"I'm like you, too, about the yearly fees.",sd
132830,B,Yeah.,b
132831,A,"I don't, uh, I don't like to pay the yearly fee for a card.",sd
132832,A,"Right now both the MasterCard and the Visa, we don't have to pay a yearly fee on",sd

132834,B,Uh-huh.,b
132835,B,"Right,",b
132836,B,yeah.,b
132837,A,Now we had American Express cards,sd
132838,A,"and my husband had always had that before we got married,",sd
132839,A,"and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something I think,",sd
132840,B,Yeah.,b
132841,A,I can't remember,sd
132842,A,but we decided let that one go,sd
132843,A,"and,",%
132844,B,"Well, my husband and I both have that",sd
132845,B,"and I don't know what we pay for his card,",sd
132846,B,"I pay I think,",sd
132847,B,I have a gold one,sd
132848,B,"so, I think it's like seventy-five dollars for me",sd
132849,A,Uh-huh.,b
132850,A,Yeah.,b
132851,B,and I'm not quite sure what it is for him.,sd
132852,B,But I had really like,sd
132853,B,there,%
132854,B,"nowadays I'm not so sure that it's worth it,",sd
132855,A,Uh-huh.,b
132856,B,"but, um, in the past there, you know, there are some places that only take American Express",sd
132857,A,Yeah.,b
132858,B,"and then they don't have the credit limit because I've over done the credit limit on the other card,",sd
132859,B,"if my husband and I both travel, it, you know, a couple of plain tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card.",sd
132860,A,Yeah.,b
132861,B,"And, um, with the American Express they say there is no limit.",sd
132862,B,There really is,sd
132863,B,"but they, tell you that,",sd
132864,B,but then that was one advantage,sd
132865,B,"but that's like,",sd
132866,B,"I don't,",sd
132867,B,I think it's seventy-five dollars for me and forty for him for a year which is a lot.,sd
132868,A,Uh-huh.,b
132869,A,Yeah.,b
132870,B,Be,%
132871,A,"But, yeah,",aa
132872,A,"like you said, if you really, if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff, it's more worth it.",sv
132873,B,"Yeah,",b
132874,B,"well, we should probably get another, um, Visa card, one, another one that's free.",sd
132875,A,Uh-huh.,b
132876,B,"Because there are some,",sd
132877,B,like I think A T and T has one that's free if you make two purchases a year.,sd
132878,A,Oh.,b
132879,B,"Well so,",%
132880,A,"Yeah,",b
132881,A,that wouldn't be too hard to do,sv
132882,B,"Yeah,",b
132883,B,"and so that's easy enough to do,",sv
132884,B,"and if that's true, that's, um, it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit. And get rid of the American Express because it costs so much.",sd
132885,A,Yeah.,b
132886,A,"Have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to, be stuck with that?",qy

132889,B,No.,nn
132890,B,"I,",%
132891,B,"and I don't I mean, I guess I do understand the mentality of people doing it",sd
132892,B,but I don't understand.,sd
132893,B,because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay.,sv
132894,B,I have had months where I was shocked at how much had come in because like I thought I would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process,sd
132895,A,Uh-huh.,b
132896,B,and sometimes it comes in right away,sd
132897,B,"and it's like, oh, well, guess, I have to pay that too.",sd
132898,A,Yeah.,b
132899,B,"Because like many times I'll I'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking, hey, I won't get that bill until the next bill, not this bill.",sd
132900,A,Right.,b
132901,B,"And it will come in on the next one,",sd
132902,B,you have to pay for it right away anyway.,sd
132903,A,Yeah,b
132904,B,But sometimes the is long .,sd
132905,B,Like I've had things that I didn't get billed on for two or three months.,sd
132906,A,"Yeah,",aa
132907,A,I guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something.,sd
132908,B,Yeah.,b
132909,A,Lot of places have,sd
132910,A,"I guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in the minute,  you charge it.",sd
132911,B,Immediately.,bf
132912,B,"Yeah,",b
132913,A,Yeah.,b
132914,B,"but, that's what happened with us",sd
132915,B,"like we bought a washing machine seven months ago,",sd
132916,A,Oh.,b
132917,B,and that I got billed like the next day,sd
132918,A,"Oh, gosh.",ba
132919,B,It didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check,sd
132920,B,but we prefer,sd
132921,B,"like with the credit card you get the automatic, um, one year guarantee so if something breaks, things like that.",sd
132922,A,"Yeah,",b
132923,A,that's nice.,ba
132924,B,"You can, uh, return it so like the washing machine we bought it in October",sd
132925,B,"and, you know, if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee.",sd
132926,A,Right.,b
132927,B,"And somethings like that are,",sd
132928,A,"Yeah,",b
132929,A,I like that feature,sd
132930,A,"and the like if you break it yourself even, you know,",sd
132931,B,Right.,b
132932,A,if you buy something that's breakable.,sd
132933,B,Or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be,bf
132934,A,Yeah.,b
132935,B,"and so, so that's, you know, another advantage. And then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which, um, you , hopefully you never use.",sd
132936,B,But like if your,sd
132937,B,"but things like if your baggage gets lost, you get money for that to buy new bags and things like that.",sd
132938,A,"Oh, really?",bh
132939,A,"Oh, I didn't know that.",sd
132940,B,"And yeah,",aa
132941,B,"when you rent a car, you get that",sd
132942,B,and sometimes you get discounts with the cards,sd
132943,B,and so ...,%

132960,B,The DALLAS MORNING NEWS is a good paper.,sv

133417,A,"You know, they didn't sort of encourage, I mean businesses and things to use it,",sd

133451,B,it really would.,sv

133454,A,Yeah.,b
133455,B,"It would be difficult,",sv

133457,A,Right.,b
133458,B,That's,%

133460,B,Right.,b
133461,A,"And if they kept it up,",sv

133470,A,"and I think that before, it was just, you know, just a bunch of little kids using it.",sv
133471,B,Right.,b
133472,A,"And now I think there are enough people,",sv
133473,A,"you know, sort of as we get older, I think others that will bring more generations in on it, eventually they'll be able to make the switch,",sv

133502,B,Right.,b

134576,A,"I think we have that problem dealing in most areas, which is unfortunate.",sv

135577,B,"and I have a suspicion that, that I believe that a, the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or, or let it go, one or the other.",sv
135578,B,What is your situation?,qo
135579,A,"Well, I'm, I guess I don't have such close experience with, with, um, an area becoming a state as you do.",sd
135580,A,"Um, my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low uh, standard of living or at least, um, annual average income.",sv
135581,A,"Um, part of this I suppose is justified in, in that the climate they don't need, perhaps, the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need.",sv

135593,A,"and, I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors, um.",sd
135594,B,"Your concern on the economy was one in terms of, if it became a state would that put even more pressures on, on Puerto Rico, or pressures on the U. S. in terms of aid",qy

135596,A,"Well probably more on, in terms of the U. S. Um,",sv

135601,A,"so, I was very cut off from the, the press as I, you know, and be, was becoming an adult.",sd

135603,B,Uh-huh.,b
135604,A,"Um, I guess, you know, we'd have a lot of aid, if, if you consider the inner cities of like New York and, and how much aid it needs.",sv
135605,A,"I suppose the whole country, or the whole, um, new state would require such aid.",sv
135606,B,"I guess, um, we're assuming that, that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than, than say Mississippi",qy^d
135607,B,"or,",%
135608,A,I think so.,na
135609,B,"Okay,",bk
135610,B,"that's something that, that I guess I have not much of an image of other than, than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a, in a carefree sense, I guess.",sd
135611,B,"Although I'm aware of the political problems and unrest, and, and also difficulties they have. Um, I don't know whether state statehood would improve their economy.",sv
135612,B,"I don't, I don't know that the the act of being a state would have any impact on, on them.",sd
135613,B,"Uh, I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now.",sv
135614,B,But of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax.,sd
135615,B,"I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being, since they aren't a state, whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be.",sd
135616,B,"How do you feel, though, about,",qh
135617,B,"well I guess it's to their advantage to be a territory,",sv
135618,B,"but, um, I wonder how have, having been in a territory but only as a young student",sd
135619,B,and my parents were in the military at the time,sd
135620,B,"so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in, in Alaska at the time since they voted absentee.",sd
135621,B,"I, I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry, uh, to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote.",sv
135622,B,"The District of Columbia people, for instance are quite frustrated, I think, at times in their not having a Senate representative.",sv
135623,A,Uh-huh.,b
135624,A,"Yeah,",%
135625,A,"those, are good points, um, which obviously I had never thought about.",sd
135626,A,"Uh, I don't know, uh, I suppose they also, not being a state are probably freer to determine their own, um, ways of life than they would if, if,",sv
135627,A,I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory.,sd
135628,B,Uh-huh.,b
135629,B,"Uh, I see what you mean,",aa
135630,B,"so that,",%
135631,B,"Yeah,",b
135632,B,taxes would undoubtedly be occurring.,sv
135633,B,"Uh, there,",%
135634,B,"I don't know, I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation.",sd
135635,B,"Um, frequently the laws in a territory are, are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states,",sv
135636,B,"I,",%
135637,B,and I'm thinking in terms of education.,sd
135638,B,But then again each state sets its own,sd
135639,B,and I don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico.,sd
135640,B,"Um, it's interesting because I haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to, uh, economy, uh, I had thought of it more in terms of political, uh, realization",sd
135641,B,"and I guess I had automatically made the assumption that, gee, anyone would rather be a state of the U. S. than an independent country",sd
135642,B,"so,",%
135643,A,Uh-huh.,b
135644,A,"Well, well actually I",%
135645,A,"one, one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language, which I always assumed it was anyway.",sd
135646,A,"So, if they've just taken such action, it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or Hispanic heritage.",sd
135647,B,"Uh-huh,",b
135648,B,well that's interesting too.,ba
135649,B,"Well it sounds as though you are in favor of, uh, status quo.",qy^d
135650,A,"I, I believe I would probably tend towards that.",na
135651,B,"And I think, uh, having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these.",sd
135652,B,"So I'm I guess I'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point, leaning towards the statehood.",sv
135653,A,Well that's interesting.,ba
135654,A,Right.,b
135655,A,"What about if, if, um, they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood.",qh
135656,B,"I think I would be troubled,",sv
135657,B,"I suspect, I believe that any of our states,",sd
135658,B,"and I,",%
135659,B,constitutionally I don't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something.,sd
135660,B,"Um, I don't think there is any prohibitions.",sd
135661,B,I would be bothered by that.,sv
135662,B,"I'm, I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's strengths",sv
135663,B,"and that's the, the, the melting pot.",sd
135664,A,Uh-huh.,b
135665,B,"Uh, I, I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines,",sd
135666,B,"but I'm troubled by too close a clinging to, to the past",sv
135667,B,"and I'm also realizing that, that a common language, I think, is the ultimate bond of a country.",sv
135668,A,Uh-huh.,b
135669,B,"And Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever.",sd
135670,B,"Uh, that I, I think that would be a negative step to make",sd
135671,B,and I think that that they would need to reassess that.,sv
135672,B,"Um, I'm troubled even in by bilingualism, uh, in so far that it it gets in the way of, of, of the melting pot aspect.",sv
135673,A,"Uh-huh,",b
135674,A,uh-huh.,b
135675,A,"That's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual, Spanish based on experience, um, I was in bilingual education in California",sd
135676,A,and I didn't have any problem with my students,sd
135677,A,"but I noticed my, my brother, who was quite a bit younger, was learning Spanish in elementary school",sd
135678,A,and he can't speak a word.,sd
135679,B,Um.,b
135680,A,"And so, obviously it didn't work in California.",sd

136358,A,and I don't know how they sort that.,sd
136359,A,"But if, if I used a lot of can goods and I do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles, I would think that I I would have a recycling center.",sd

136363,B,right.,^q
136364,A,"Yeah,",ny
136365,A,I know what you're saying.,sd
136366,A,"But we have, we have a very aggressive recycling at work,",sd

136369,A,"Instead of carrying your newspapers, when they get done with them at the end of the day, they throw them in the trash.",sv

136371,A,"Um, no,",nn
136372,A,"we don't,",sd
136373,A,"but other, other offices do.",sd
136374,A,They have a box for papers.,sd
136375,B,"Well, we have, we have one that's recyclable and, and then for uh, lunch sacks and waste food",sd
136376,B,and they gave us a list of things that aren't,sd
136377,B,and it turns out it's not so bad.,sd
136378,B,"I, I get a lot of reports that, that are covered in plastic or like saran wrap or something, anyway,",sd
136379,B,"and then, uh, cardboard, there's a few,",sd
136380,B,"it's interesting that we're, we're recycling computer type paper.",sd
136381,A,Yeah.,b
136382,B,"And, and, uh, one day they'll pick up, uh,",sd
136383,B,"the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper,",sd
136384,B,"and then the next day they'll pick up the other,",sd
136385,B,so.,%
136386,A,Oh.,b
136387,B,"Depending on how much,",sd
136388,B,"you know, and there's a lot of, actually, it works pretty well,",sd
136389,B,"and then we have a, uh, waste, uh, cans for aluminum in the, in the break areas at work.",sd
136390,A,"Well, that's, that's a really good idea, because, um, like our, uh, fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit.",sd
136391,B,Yeah.,b
136392,A,"And they're thinking about putting a deposit on them, because pretty much you have to, you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans, where they're so much easier just to put a deposit on it, because most, probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits, because they're beer and soda,",sv
136393,B,"Yeah,",b
136394,A,"but when they sell juice, it's some strange quirk in the law, you don't have to have a deposit on it.",sd
136395,A,"And even like, the, a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it,",sd
136396,A,"but if it's got soda in it, it does.",sd
136397,A,"So, it's a strange.",sd
136398,B,That's an interesting distinction.,sd
136399,A,"Yeah,",b
136400,A,"they should, they should clean, clear that up.",sv
136401,A,"It wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on the, uh, juice cans as easily as the soda.",sd
136402,B,Yeah.,b
136403,A,"So, but redemption centers are a big thing up here,",sd
136404,A,they get a penny a can they handle.,sd
136405,A,They give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor.,sd
136406,A,I think they either get a penny or two pennies a can.,sv
136407,B,"Well, see, well, see, those of us that don't have state income taxes,",sd
136408,B,"yet that's the big debate here in Texas, that the legislature wants to put one in,",sd
136409,A,Yeah.,b
136410,B,"and, it's interesting what people get upset about,",sd
136411,B,"uh, it really is.",sd

136421,A,"well, I know, I was in Atlanta,",sd
136422,A,and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand.,sd
136423,A,"But here, Let me put that in a paper cup for you.",sd
136424,A,So that was strange.,sd
136425,A,"But, I think,",sv
136426,A,"if some people they have,",sv
136427,A,"they say, well, we're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these, um, the, the recycle center, you have to deal with the can and then you have to, to recycle it,",sv
136428,A,"and, their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits see how they handle it,",sv
136429,B,Yeah.,b
136430,A,"and see if it's a good way,",sd
136431,A,"and then do it that way. Because, as, like I say, people are making money on it.",sd
136432,B,"Well, you know, the other, Well the other thing is, it also is, is a, is a, a good habit, uh, to, uh, just to conserve resources, you know, where they, you know, because you get in the habit of that, you think in terms of, of, uh, of, of things like saving",sv

136480,A,right.,aa
136481,A,"I think pretty much you summed up my, my, my motivations also.",sd

138592,B,"And, um, T I, where I work has, uh, a fitness center",sd

138609,A,"And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too.",sv
138610,B,Yeah.,b
138611,A,It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up.,sv

138613,A,when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children.,sv

138616,B,"But it's hard to find, uh, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, you know, because like I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes",sd
138617,B,and I don't know if that would work for me because I don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain.,sd
138618,B,"But it's really hard to find something that works, and, you know, to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever.",sv
138619,B,I think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever.,sv
138620,A,Yeah.,b
138621,B,Yeah.,b
138622,A,"You have to,",sv
138623,A,what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself.,sv
138624,B,Huh-uh.,b
138625,A,"And you can use what ever rationale you want,",sv
138626,A,"but basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live.",sv
138627,B,Right.,aa
138628,A,"And, uh, you know, if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, well, then I'll around a lot longer,",sv
138629,A,"And those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, well, you know, get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it.",sv

138638,B,"He's, he's, kind of, he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing.",sd
138639,B,"Um, he was talking about the three things you could, that cause aging smoking are inactivity, * mistranscribed? listen",sd
138640,B,"and what was the other one, I think was, yeah, obesity.",sd
138641,B,"If you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, you know, cause those are risk factors,",sd
138642,B,"so anyway, it's kind of a tip.",sd
138643,A,Yeah.,b
138644,A,"Oh, I've done a lot of study over the years",sd
138645,A,and I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water.,sd
138646,B,Really,b
138647,A,Yeah.,b
138648,A,"Um, the research that I've done",sd
138649,A,and I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three.,sd

138652,B,Huh-uh.,b
138653,A,There were none prior to nineteen-hundred.,sd
138654,A,"Well, in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water. In nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities,",sd
138655,A,"and after that we, we started having the hearts attacks",sd
138656,A,"and, uh, Dr. Price wrote a book CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL, AND CHLORINE.",sd

138668,A,"um, but he makes a very good case against chlorine.",sd
138669,A,There were no heart attacks before we started using it,sd
138670,A,"and he points out that people in, uh, England",sd
138671,A,"and, uh, or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now,",sd
138672,A,and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks.,sd
138673,A,Yeah.,b
138674,A,"He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours. And, uh, proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which is the, clogging of the arteries.",sd

138676,B,Yeah.,b
138677,A,"And, uh, you know, he's,",%

138682,A,well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.,sd
138683,B,Huh-uh.,b
138684,A,"You know, it's amazing what he points out in that book",sd
138685,A,"and, in fact, he, everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency, who did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price in nineteen eighty-seven.

144342,B,"Uh, and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in, in the car,",sd

146118,B,"Yeah,",aa
146119,B,"yeah,",aa
146120,B,"that is the extreme,",sv

146134,A,"yeah,",aa

146138,B,Yeah.,aa
146139,B,That's true.,aa

150021,A,"But, um, one that, um, I thought was a problem that , I thought it was a serious problem, that I'm not sure it's being taken care of right now, uh, was like bilingual education for, um, different, um, minority groups and like Asians and, um, uh, Mexican Americans and, and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they and in this area,",sv

150382,B,but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation.,sd

150385,B,"I mean, yes,",ny
150386,B,"having a budget is very, very important",sd
150387,B,"and that did get us so that, you know, the house is paid for and, uh, other major things are taken care of",sd

150397,A,"We don't, I, I don't know of a written figure of expenses that we, you know, keep to or anything,",sd

150400,A,A certain amount.,sd
150401,B,"I think I've, I do that automatically myself.",sd
150402,A,Yeah.,b
150403,B,"I mean, I unconsciously, uh, you know, stay in a, within a, with a certain amount because I, I have enough food already stored here that I don't have to make any large purchase at any one time.",sd
150404,A,Oh.,b
150405,B,All I normally do now is pick up little things here and there. If the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that.,sd

150408,B,"Yeah,",b

150413,A,Oh.,b
150414,A,"Oh, you guys sound pretty self sufficient",sv
150415,B,"Well, we, we keep a little note pad on a, on a wall.",sd

150418,A,Huh.,b
150419,B,"So it's, it's worked very well that way.",sd

150423,B,That way we keep up to date,sd

150425,A,"Let's see,",^h
150426,A,"the other thing there the topic was talking about was, if, if, uh,",sd

150429,A,another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas.,sd

150431,A,but somehow we get back there.,sd

150436,A,Huh?,br

150439,B,Yeah.,b
150440,B,Sure.,b
150441,B,"Well, I think we unconsciously do the same thing.",sd

150444,A,that's all right.,bd

150451,B,"each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that, that we gather together over a period a time enough money to, to make this trip.",sd

150453,A,"Uh-huh,",aa
150454,A,that's right.,aa
150455,B,and I think we just sort of unconsciously do it.,sd

153326,B,do you consider yourself a liberal?,qy
153327,A,Um I would say I'm probably liberal,na
153328,A,yeah,ny
153329,B,Well let me ask you this then.,ad
153330,A,yeah,b
153331,A,Sure,aa
153332,B,How is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag?,qo
153333,A,Well I'll tell you.,^h
153334,A,"I I think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag, it would never happen",sv
153335,A,do you know what I mean?,qh
153336,B,Huh.,b
153337,A,It's only because they make a big stink over it.,sv
153338,A,But I I guess actually I believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag I guess that's their opportunity,sv
153339,A,They're they're they're right in the sense of freedom of speech,sv
153340,A,But I would never,sd
153341,B,Well now wait a minute there,ad
153342,A,Yeah.,aa
153343,B,you just said it.,sd
153344,B,It's their right by freedom of speech?,qy
153345,B,What does speech have to do with burning a flag?,qw
153346,A,Yeah.,b
153347,A,Well it's,%
153348,A,that they,%
153349,A,I think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to,sv
153350,A,and I uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your uh your ideas you know,sv
153351,A,"the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that Uh,",sv
153352,A,though I would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself,sd
153353,A,I I I think uh you know,sv
153354,A,but I I still,%
153355,A,what the flag stands for I guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed,sv
153356,A,uh,b
153357,B,Now uh Well I I still go back to ...,%
153358,A,Unless the burn unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know,sd
153359,A,but I I think that's I guess that's I that's my opinion,sd
153360,A,Yeah,%
153361,A,I guess you feel differently.,qy^d
153362,B,Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building?,qy
153363,A,"Uh, no",nn
153364,A,but I think that's that's uh it's that's taxpayer's money.,sv
153365,A,If somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine,sv
153366,A,but that that's you know that's destruction and of uh public property and whatever.,sv
153367,B,"Uh, then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh what a public uh symbol.",bf
153368,A,No,aa
153369,A,I don't know,no
153370,A,I guess the symbolism,%
153371,A,oh I think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government.,sv
153372,B,Uh yeah,b
153373,A,Uh I think that's what's made democracy,sv
153374,B,but here again I go back to the second amendment,sd
153375,B,"You can disagree by freedom of speech which, has nothing to do with action.",sv
153376,A,Yeah.,b
153377,A,Uh-huh.,b
153378,A,Yeah.,b
153379,A,Well that's that's true,aa
153380,B,Now I am I am adamantly against that.,sd
153381,A,Yeah,b
153382,A,But I think I I,%
153383,A,Yeah,b
153384,A,I I I guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers.,sd
153385,A,Um. there uh one of the Republican the appointees for the the judicial bench,sd
153386,A,and they always talk about they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down.,sd
153387,B,Uh-huh.,b
153388,A,And Um I believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in,sv
153389,B,huh.,b
153390,A,my understanding of how it was framed is that you this the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government,sd
153391,A,and you can display that.,sd
153392,B,Yeah.,b
153393,B,Uh-huh.,b
153394,A,"Uh, I Yeah,",%
153395,A,I,%
153396,A,and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever I I think that that's viable.,sv
153397,A,Um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point. I think.,sv
153398,A,Yeah,%
153399,A,"Because, realistically, like for you for you you don't think it's right",qy^d
153400,B,No.,nn
153401,A,And I would never do it.,sd
153402,A,"I I love this country too much,",sd
153403,A,and that symbol means a lot to me.,sd
153404,B,Uh-huh.,b
153405,A,Um. But I guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something it's a need for them you know.,sv
153406,B,Well here again we uh,%
153407,B,even though you uh physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself.,bf
153408,A,Yeah.,b
153409,A,Yes.,b
153410,A,No.,aa
153411,B,Nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country.,bf
153412,A,Right.,aa
153413,A,Yeah.,aa
153414,A,Uh huh.,aa
153415,B,"Uh, um so long as it's their possession.",bf
153416,B,"Ok, you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh, what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country,",aap_am
153417,A,Uh huh.,b
153418,B,and I used to know as a Boy Scout,sd
153419,B,"but all I remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country, and to maintain it.",sd
153420,A,Yeah.,b
153421,B,"And, to me that's uh uh black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country.",sv
153422,A,I agree there too.,aa

153429,B,It's It's very easy to do.,sv
153430,A,"it when it's uh it's an emotional issue,",sv
153431,A,and you sit,sv
153432,A,and you try and think about it logically,sv
153433,A,"and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing,",sv
153434,A,uh but logically um,%
153435,A,"even you know for instance, the pro life pro choice movement, uh you know",sd
153436,A,"I don't know anybody that actually supports abortion,",sd
153437,A,but they would vote pro choice.,sd
153438,B,Uh,b

153446,A,"but it that's uh that's what I mean,",sd
153447,A,"see,",%
153448,A,"but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing,",sv
153449,A,and it evokes an emotional response.,sv
153450,A,"I think that's the hardest thing,",sv
153451,A,"I don't know if I could ever be a judge, because some things emotionally just aren't you know",sd

153456,A,"No,",nn
153457,A,no,nn
153458,A,I think the um,%
153459,A,sometimes I guess,%
153460,A,what did I read recently,t1
153461,A,the um the uh Christian uh point is is always the point of well it's at conception,sd
153462,A,but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term.,sd
153463,A,And there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology.,sd
153464,B,Huh.,b
153465,A,so then that so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then.,sd
153466,A,So it's,%
153467,A,I don't know.,no
153468,A,It's very it's it's uh you know It's a it's a topsy-turvy world,sv

155693,A,Hi.,fp
155694,B,"Well, what do you think?",qo
155695,A,"Well, providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task",sv
155696,A,"and I, uh, personally, I don't approve of it for two reasons.",sd
155697,A,"Number one is that I think that, uh, the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now,",sv
155698,A,"and if they were to administer this, they would, uh, get us more and more into debt, further than we can ever get out ourselves.",sv
155699,A,"Number two I think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would, would be dried up",sv
155700,A,"and really no one would be, would only answer to, to the government to a big bureaucratic mess.",sv
155701,A,"And, uh, I've seen what it has done in other countries",sd
155702,A,"and so I don't think, uh, I don't think we should head in that direction.",sv
155703,A,Although that we have problems right now,sv
155704,A,and I do agree that they exist,aa
155705,A,"because health care insurance for, for everyone is skyrocketing",sv
155706,A,and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore.,sv
155707,B,Uh-huh.,b
155708,A,How do you feel about the whole ordeal?,qo
155709,B,"Well, I agree that it's a big task,",aa
155710,B,"but I think that, I think that the U S should move toward some kind of national health care plan. At least as a long term kind of goal.",sv
155711,A,Uh-huh.,b
155712,B,"And possibly, just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing,",sv
155713,B,"but I think that ultimately it would be a good idea to, uh,",sv
155714,B,"and not have a completely socialized, medical system in the country, maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now.",sv
155715,A,Uh-huh.,b
155716,A,Okay.,bk
155717,B,"It, uh, just because it seems that, uh, health insurance costs are sky rocketing, well, as fast as the national deficit perhaps",sv
155718,A,"Oh, yeah.",b

155720,B,"and  that's a   that's a vicious cycle, of course.",sv
155721,A,"But what,",%
155722,A,"What you're  Yeah,",%
155723,A,"so what you're  saying though, is instead of having the national government, uh, government administer, giving health insurance to every man, woman and child with, throughout the whole company, you see more of them as regulating the high costs, uh, that people are forced to pay for it right now.",bf
155724,B,"Because,",%
155725,A,"Is that is that correct,",qy
155726,B,"Um,",b
155727,A,"or do you think that,",qrr
155728,B,"Well, I, uh, well, I wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately.",arp_nd
155729,B,I don't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea.,sv
155730,B,"And, uh",%
155731,A,"Well, with the, with the costs as they are right now, do you think that the government, uh,",qy
155732,A,"because what that would require is for us to pay, uh, more taxes",sv
155733,A,"and the, the the people that can afford taxes, the middle income and the upper income will be paying more taxes to, to pay for health insurance for everyone, whereas right now the, the public themselves get health insurance",sv
155734,B,Right.,b
155735,A,and they provide their own health insurance.,sv
155736,B,"The, well, as it is now, the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance",sv
155737,B,and so that the other people have no health insurance,sv
155738,B,"and, you know, they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies",sv
155739,B,and somebody winds up paying for that,sv
155740,B,and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance,sv
155741,B,"so I don't see that anything, that this situation would get any worse.",sv

155746,A,"The reason being is, uh, we have,",%
155747,A,"I don't know,",h

155749,B,Uh-huh.,b
155750,A,"and, uh, the, the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and, and, uh, don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business, whereas the federal government if they took over everything, they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business.",sv
155751,A,"People would still have to pay taxes,",sv
155752,A,the money would have to come from somewhere,sv
155753,A,and so you'd,%
155754,A,"I, I feel that the cost would increase dramatically also.",sv

156615,B,Uh-huh.,b
156616,A,"Uh, long term, that's a little bit easier for us because, uh, with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings, Four Oh One K plans uh, that kind of, you know, retirement plans, that kind of stuff",sd
156617,B,Uh-huh.,b
156618,A,so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see  versus when it's on the paycheck,sd

156621,A,You always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month,sv

156629,A,"So that kind of works out where you get into, uh, some plans that, you know, you touch it you're going to get a penalty, that kind of thing,",sv

157286,A,"because they were like oh, well, we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it.",sv
157287,B,"Well, they didn't, they didn't have a since of risk.",qy^d
157288,A,"No,",nn
157289,A,I don't think so.,sd
157290,B,"Oh, okay.",bk
157291,A,"And, uh, plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in, any, almost any type of loan",sd
157292,A,"and like some banks, you know, they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make.",sd
157293,B,Uh-huh.,b
157294,A,And I think the S and L were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make.,sd
157295,B,Okay.,bk
157296,A,"And I think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve, then I don't think this would have happened.",sv
157297,B,Okay.,bk
157298,B,"Well do you think we, there's a final accounting, yet not, in the since of pennies an nickels,",qy
157299,B,"but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or, or that, that they really do understand how much money it is,",qy
157300,B,"for awhile it seemed like every time I opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of damage, uh,",sd
157301,A,Uh-huh.,b
157302,B,"did, is your since that we now understand how bad it is, *listen",sd
157303,B,or is there more to be heard yet.,qrr
157304,A,"Um, I think that people just basically got tired of hearing it",sv
157305,A,"and it wasn't making, it was wasn't as good news as it was.",sv
157306,A,"I think it's still, you know, I adding up,",sv
157307,A,and I think it will be for awhile.,sv
157308,B,"So you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet,",bf
157309,A,No.,aa
157310,B,or whether .,%
157311,A,"I, I don't think they do.",aa
157312,A,"I don't think how, I don't think how they could find that big, how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose, because there still are some S and Ls still open.",sv
157313,B,Uh-huh.,b
157314,A,"And it's, it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this.",sv
157315,B,To be caught in the .,bf
157316,A,"Uh-huh,",aa
157317,A,uh-huh.,aa
157318,B,Do you think to possibly is that it will help with the regular banks?,qy
157319,A,"I, I don't know.",no
157320,A,I I think it would be harder,sv
157321,A,but I think there are some regular banks that will go down with it.,sv
157322,B,"It seems that I recall reading for the last oh, let's say starting three years a go but not so much in the last year of bank risks of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico, Venezuela. Uh, and Argentina based on oil loans",sd
157323,A,Uh-huh.,b
157324,B,"and then the price of oil had, had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky,",sd
157325,B,and I guess I read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans.,sd
157326,B,"I have this vague since that, that could happen that, that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost.",sv
157327,A,"Oh, yeah, um,",aa
157328,A,in some of my classes now I was just reading,sd
157329,A,I think it was in Venezuela,sd
157330,A,"I can't remember what company it was,",sd
157331,A,but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back.,sd
157332,B,Uh-huh.,b
157333,A,"You know, and they just, they just wrote it right off.",sd
157334,A,"I think, I think we've lost a lot of money",sv
157335,A,"and, you know, like we every never going to get it back",sv
157336,A,it's impossible to get it back.,sv
157337,B,And so you think that it's just gone.,bf
157338,A,"Uh-huh,",aa
157339,A,"uh-huh,",aa
157340,A,"yeah,",aa
157341,A,"cause we're, you know, we're talking about some peens that have just like even gave up on like getting it back and trying any more.",sv
157342,B,Okay.,b
157343,A,They just totally wrote it off their book.,sv
157344,B,Do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program,qy
157345,B,like my since is it was there to try to protect small investors,sv
157346,B,"but it ended up protecting big investors. Which I don't think what it was meant to do,",sv
157347,A,Oh.,b
157348,B,"so I guess I, I feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems.",sv
157349,A,"Uh-huh,",ny
157350,A,"um, yeah,",ny
157351,A,"I think is it necessary to have, um, the backing, um,",sv
157352,A,"it, it's, it's just for, you know, safe purposes, you know, in case something would happen. Um,",sv
157353,A,"yeah,",%
157354,A,"I don't, I",%
157355,A,"yeah,",%
157356,A,as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to have something.,sv
157357,B,"Um, so your since is that the, that, uh, the loan guaranties which really were accounts guaranties, so the, so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money.",bf
157358,A,Uh-huh.,aa
157359,A,Right.,aa
157360,B,"And given that the S and Ls have had disasters then those account holders are, are, their money is still being protected.",bf
157361,A,Uh-huh.,aa
157362,B,"And that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands I guess of, Of dollars being protected.",bf
157363,A,Uh-huh.,aa
157364,B,"It, it seems like, um, there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts, uh,",sv
157365,B,"it's,",%
157366,B,"if, if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred billion dollars",sd
157367,B,and we're taking about monies way in access of that now,sd
157368,B,so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts.,sv
157369,A,Uh-huh.,b
157370,B,And perhaps multiple people in multiple S and Ls,sv
157371,B,"and, and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about, rethought.",sv
157372,A,Yeah.,b
157373,B,"You know that the, for,",%
157374,B,"I guess I'm content with the need to have protection on, on accounts",sd
157375,B,but I feel likes it's on an individual basis.,sv
157376,B,Someone whose got accounts in thirty-five different S and Ls or thirty or forty thousand dollars,%
157377,B,and they're all protected by the government.,sv
157378,B,Seems to me like they've gotten around what was intended to be the issue there.,sv
157379,B,"Uh-huh,",b
157380,B,"I guess I don't have a personal since of V on it since I, was not a heavy user of any S and Ls",sd
157381,A,Uh-huh.,b
157382,B,"and, and let alone any of them that went bankrupt.",sd
157383,B,"And I guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again,",sv
157384,A,"I think it could happen,",aa
157385,B,"because that means, I'm not worried enough, uh,",sd
157386,A,"yeah,",b
157387,B,it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive,sv
157388,B,"and then I, then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things.",sv
157389,A,I think it'll happen again,aa
157390,A,but I think it will be a long time in the future before it does happen again.,sv
157391,A,Because I think like the bank people in any kind of people like that are going to be worry enough not to let it happen again in the near future.,sv
157392,A,But I think later on they're going to start and forget about and start making the riskier loans,sv
157393,A,"because I mean, you're going to have to take some risk",sv
157394,A,"and as long as their backed I think they're still going, you know, start taking on riskier loans,",sv
157395,A,"and I think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until, you know, late, you know, in the future.",sv
157396,B,Uh-huh.,aa
157397,B,"Well, perhaps if there are regulatory, uh, constraints put back in place. It will protect that",sv
157398,A,Uh-huh.,b
157399,B,"maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation, uh.",sv
157400,A,"Well, my family moved to Texas about eight years ago.",sd
157401,A,"My husband was raised here, by",sd
157402,A,"I, I have never lived here,",sd
157403,A,"so, um, when we came back to Texas, I was really kind of excited.",sd
157404,A,There wasn't a state income tax,sd
157405,A,"and there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the, the grocery store and things.",sd
157406,B,Huh-uh.,b
157407,A,"And all of that was new to me,",sd
157408,A,because I'm sort of feeling like we're getting a better deal here than what I was accustomed to.,sd
157409,B,Yeah.,b
157410,B,Did you move from the Northeast?,qy
157411,A,"Well, I lived in Missouri and then in Utah",arp_nd
157412,A,"and them, um, both places had pretty good state income tax.",sd
157413,A,"And, um, we've always paid tax, you know, on everything we purchased, even food at the grocery store.",sd
157414,A,"So, I thought it was really, you know, kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries",sd
157415,A,"and, but, I think, I mean, I don't enjoy paying taxes.",sd
157416,A,"And it's hard,",sv
157417,A,"but, um, I think that is what we have to have, you know, have our streets and have, have our government and Excuse me. And have, and have the services that we need",sv
157418,A,"and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and, and things like that",sv
157419,A,"and I think, I guess, what I feel is that most people, um, they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like there's some people that aren't paying their fair share.",sv
157420,B,Yeah.,aa
157421,B,"I think,",%
157422,B,yeah.,aa
157423,A,"And, um, that makes you feel bad.",sv
157424,B,People that can really influence the government have all the money to throw.,sv
157425,A,Right.,aa
157426,A,"And you know, when, um, when last year the elections were going, on the governors election and state and, you know.",sd
157427,A,"I, I didn't have anything against Clayton Williams personally or anything,",sd
157428,A,"but, um, it was kind of hard for me to think, here's someone as wealthy as he is,",sd
157429,A,didn't have to pay any income tax.,sd
157430,A,"That he said that year,",%
157431,A,"he claimed, he had, he didn't have to pay income tax",sd
157432,A,"and he thought, you know,",%
157433,A,"there's some people are living pretty, pretty good life styles,",sv
157434,A,but they're not paying income tax.,sv
157435,A,"And that's not fair, to me.",sv
157436,B,No.,aa
157437,A,"And there's, you know, some people, you know, who are abusing the systems that we pay taxes to support",sv
157438,A,and all that makes us feel bad.,sv
157439,A,"But I think, all in all, how I feel, is that, um, I'm willing to pay the taxes because I think I like our country compared to the other countries I've studied and visited.",sd
157440,A,And I'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services that I enjoy.,sd
157441,A,How do you feel?,qo
157442,B,"Well, yeah.",b
157443,B,I agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get,aa
157444,B,"and, and I think that, you know, I don't think that there's any really, any system that everybody would think is fair, as far as, being taxed.",sv
157445,A,Huh-uh.,b
157446,A,Huh-uh.,b
157447,B,"So, I guess, in Texas with,",%
157448,B,"we live here also,",sd
157449,A,Huh-uh.,b
157450,B,"and that it's mostly sales tax,",sv
157451,B,"so it's, really the people that have money to buy things are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff.",sv
157452,A,Huh-uh.,b
157453,B,I've lived in Texas most of my life.,sd
157454,B,"We, um, lived in Kansas City for a couple of years,",sd
157455,B,and we were kind of in for a rude awakening.,sd
157456,B,They had personal property taxes on like cars,sd
157457,B,"and, the first year we were there it was kind of like, eight hundred dollars,",sd
157458,A,"Oh, no.",ba
157459,B,And we're like .,sd
157460,B,My husband says I used to complain to pay sixty dollars to get licensed in Texas,sd
157461,B,"and now, you know,",%
157462,A,Huh-uh.,b
157463,B,"So, I mean, that was kind of different",sd
157464,B,"and then to file a, a state income tax, was also kind of tough, too.",sd
157465,B,"I guess, since we've been married, we've moved a lot,",sd
157466,B,"so it always seems like, you know, we're always paying taxes for something.",sd
157467,B,And it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little money back.,sd
157468,B,"But, I, um, have a accounting background,",sd
157469,A,Huh-uh.,b
157470,B,"so I then, have also done tax returns in the past for other people when I worked for an accounting firm.",sd
157471,A,Huh-uh.,b
157472,B,"And, uh, you know, it is kind of sad to see how the people that have the resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put there money in places, they don't have to pay taxes.",sv
157473,A,Right.,b
157474,B,Or to buy something that loses money so that they can offset the income that they get or whatever.,sv
157475,A,Yeah.,b
157476,B,"So, you know, I think, if, I can understand why the rich people don't want to pay, you know, a large, large percent",sd
157477,A,Huh-uh.,b
157478,B,"because, you know, that's not really fair, either.",sv
157479,B,"If they've earned money by themselves, well, you know, people just kind of given the money,",sv
157480,A,Yes.,aa
157481,B,"it's kind of depressing sometimes, I think.",sv
157482,A,"Well, it is,",aa
157483,A,"and sometimes, I think, um, well, for myself, that income that we have, we pay a certain salary,",sv
157484,A,"but, I think the employer keeps in mind this will be deducted, you know,",sv
157485,A,"so, so many taxes will be deducted from it",sv
157486,A,"and so, I think, you know, our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it.",sv
157487,B,Yeah.,b
157488,A,"And so, I think, you know, in that way, we're compensated, um, just by our society. Um,",sv
157489,A,"yet, you know, they don't pay you, um, what, just what it would take,",sv
157490,A,"and if you pay taxes on it, you wouldn't have any money left over.",sv
157491,A,"And, and, um, but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything I wish that they would, I guess, because I'm not one of them I wish that they would, you know, realize that they, they couldn't make this kind of money,",sv
157492,B,"Well, yeah,",aa
157493,B,that's true,aa
157494,A,they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else.,sv
157495,B,Yeah.,b
157496,A,"In that,",%
157497,A,"even if they made that kind of money, there's some countries that have like, fifty percent income tax, you know, that have, socialized medicines and things that,",sd
157498,B,Yeah.,b
157499,A,"they, um, they wouldn't be able to enjoy the in that.",sd
157500,A,"So that, you know, they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it.",sv
157501,A,"Yes,",aa
157502,A,they've earned it.,sv
157503,A,"And yes,",aa
157504,A,"they have such great fortune here,",sv
157505,A,"but they need to pay for it, too, because they couldn't do it somewhere else.",sv
157506,B,Yeah.,b
157507,A,"Um, I like Texas, um, not having the state income tax",sd
157508,A,and I hope that,%

158978,A,"You did that recently too, uh,?",qy

158982,B,we have brick on the outside,sd

158985,B,Completely.,sd
158986,A,That's neat isn't it.,qy

158994,A,"Uh, we went through a process of, of, uh, home repairs on a, on a rental house we had,",sd
158995,A,"probably the most extensive and, uh, the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do.",sd
158996,A,"Um, we didn't have very much money",sd
158997,A,"and so we had to do it ourselves in kind of a slow process,",sd
158998,A,"but we learned how to do, uh, retile bathtubs and, uh, oh, just all kinds of things that are unusual.",sd
158999,B,Huh-uh.,b
159000,B,So the other thing that we did was the roof of our house.,sd

159002,B,"And, uh, we did that a different color also.",sd
159003,A,Yeah.,b
159004,B,"Of course, uh, being a woman most of these things were done by the men.",sd
159005,A,Huh-uh.,b
159006,B,"And, uh, so I wasn't directly involved",sd
159007,B,"but, uh, they really were helpful, I know, to our house.",sd

159009,B,Yeah,ny
159010,B,Yes,ny
159011,A,That's awful.,ba

159013,A,We've got a scout coming up,sd
159014,A,"and, uh, uh, I think it's neat for young people to learn how to, uh, take care of their, of a household, you know, like, uh, fixing faucets, dripping faucets,  and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that.",sv
159015,B,Huh-uh.,b
159016,B,"As a matter of fact, one thing, I have a young son",sd
159017,B,"and one thing we did, was we had paneling on the inside of our, uh, front of our house, or the hall way of our house, rather,",sd
159018,B,"and we were repainting the, the front room in the hall there,",sd
159019,B,and we took down that paneling,sd
159020,B,and he helped me,sd
159021,B,"and, and, uh, he was, it was fun to work with him. And, uh, and, uh, help putty up the holes together and, and do things,  like that.",sd
159022,A,Huh-uh.,b
159023,A,"How does the paneling,",qw

159025,A,do you like it better?,qy
159026,B,"Oh, I like it so much better.",na
159027,B,It makes it so much lighter.,sd
159028,A,Yeah.,b
159029,B,"You know, it really does.",sd

159032,A,That's nice.,ba
159033,B,It's been fun.,sd

159041,A,"And, um, I have my mother living with us",sd
159042,A,and so she was in a room with a carpet,sd
159043,A,"and, of course, she's quite aged,",sd
159044,A,"she's ninety-three now,",sd
159045,A,so that meant she had problems now and then,sd
159046,A,and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down.,sd
159047,A,So it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was,sd
159048,A,"and  so that was a really positive, uh, uh,",sd
159049,B,Huh-uh.,b
159050,A,it was fairly expensive though.,sd
159051,A,"I, I was impressed,",sd
159052,A,"I think, that, uh,",%
159053,A,we had somebody do it,sd
159054,A,"and it was, it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet.",sv
159055,B,Huh-uh.,b
159056,A,"Kind of depends on the quality of carpet, I suppose,",sv
159057,B,Yeah.,b
159058,A,"but, uh, in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and, and fix the floor",sd
159059,A,"so it's, uh,",%
159060,A,"I don't know,",h
159061,A,"what ever,",h
159062,A,but they have to put stuff on the floor,sd

159083,B,"Um, matter of fact, we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa,",sd
159084,B,and we pretty much keep those maxed out.,sd
159085,A,"Oh, I was going to say that, that sounds like, like pretty many.",sd

159087,A,you had them for each of the individual stores.,bf

159095,B,"any time anybody would, you know, send me an application, you know, preapproved or whatever, I went, I took it,",sd
159096,B,and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble.,sd
159097,A,"Oh, sure.",aa
159098,B,"Um, because, see, the more credit cards you have, the more people offer them to you.",sv
159099,A,"Uh-huh,",aa
159100,A,uh-huh.,aa
159101,B,"And the more you use them, the more they send them to you.",sv

159103,B,Exactly.,na
159104,B,"The American Express was probably the worst, um, because with the Gold card,",sd
159105,B,I can't remember how much it was because I didn't even have it very long before I gave it up,sd
159106,A,Uh-huh.,b

159109,A,forty five.,ar
159110,A,"Right, uh,",%
159111,A,"I,",%

159114,A,"Exactly, you know,",aa
159115,A,"I, that's it,",aa
159116,A,"I really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards,",sd
159117,A,"so I sent back all of mine, except the ones that were free.",sd
159118,B,Uh-huh.,b
159119,A,"And, um, then, then I also limited it to one of each, one MasterCard and one Visa,",sd
159120,A,"and here, most of the stores will accept those,",sd
159121,A,and actually I then got a Discover card since they pay you back.,sd
159122,B,"Uh-huh,",b
159123,B,"yeah,",b
159124,B,"I had a Discover,",sd
159125,B,"and that was one of the ones in the group that I ended up, um, closing.",sd

159131,A,uh-huh.,b
159132,A,"Uh-huh,",b

159145,A,Actually I pay off my cards every month.,sd
159146,A,Only once in my life have I not paid.,sd
159147,B,"I think that's a really good way to handle it, because that way, if you, if you paid off every month, you never have to worry about, well, how much do I have to pay these guys, you know, this month, you know.",sv
159148,B,"This, you buy what you can afford.",sv
159149,B,I mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash it's a lot easier to keep it in check.,sv
159150,A,Right.,b
159151,A,"Uh-huh,",aa
159152,A,uh-huh.,aa
159153,A,"Well, and also in a sense, they're giving you a loan for a month",sd

159177,A,that I just.,%

159827,A,my husband was complaining the other day,sd

159830,B,You're supposed to what.,br
159831,A,"Every time he turns around I'm giving him some new rule, where you're supposed to squish up the, you know, like collapse the plastic jugs. Instead of taking them up there solid.",sd

159840,A,"Do you, uh, take your papers somewhere",qy

159851,A,"Yeah,",b
159852,A,"it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth, you know, worth bothering to go in and do,",sd

159854,B,"You know, they, they charge you, you know,",sd
159855,B,it's like a flat rate I think for picking up your garbage.,sd
159856,A,Uh-huh.,b
159857,B,"And I know a lot of people it would, would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup",sv
159858,B,and some communities are trying to do that now.,sd
159859,B,"And I think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling,",sv
159860,A,Right.,b
159861,B,"they, they charged you by, by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill.",sv

159863,A,that would be a good idea.,ba
159864,B,That that might be a better way to do it.,sv

159868,A,"Yeah,",aa
159869,A,that would be a real good motivation for people.,sv

159871,A,Right.,aa
159872,A,"Yeah,",aa
159873,A,"my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags, like you buy your garbage bag from the city,",sd
159874,B,Uh-huh.,b
159875,A,and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag,sd
159876,A,"but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything,",sd

159880,A,Yeah.,aa
159881,A,Yeah,aa
159882,A,that would be a real good idea.,sv

159894,A,Yeah,%
159895,A,"I don't know, uh,",h
159896,A,I guess it just depends on how they manage it.,sv

159898,A,I don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff.,sd
159899,A,"The center that they've got now where you take your stuff in I, I think that should be making some money. Since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week.",sd

159901,A,"And they sell, I guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it.",sd

159909,A,my husband likes Pepsi,sd

159912,A,I think it's a good reason to quit buying it.,sv

160873,A,Uh-huh.,b

164330,B,"you know, like, how, uh, these two, there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other right,",sd
164331,A,Uh-huh.,b
164332,B,and you could picture it as being Russia versus the U S during the whole time,sv
164333,A,Right.,b
164334,B,"and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same as, as themselves, you know,",sd
164335,B,"the prisoners of wars were, were the same as the people living in that country.",sd
164336,A,Right.,b
164337,B,And you didn't want that to happen.,sv
164338,B,"And to me, it had always been that way.",sd
164339,B,"I mean what happens is, you have a government, right,",sd
164340,B,"and this government controls everything, right",sd
164341,A,Yeah.,b
164342,B,and then you have the people inhabiting the country,sd
164343,B,and these people have nothing to do with the government itself.,sd
164344,A,Right.,b
164345,B,And these people are the same as you are.,sd
164346,A,Right.,b
164347,B,"And what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country, supposedly U S or Russia attacks a country, it's not going to be within the borders of the U S or Russia itself.",sv
164348,B,"Like I was telling people, I'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on.",sd
164349,B,"In in Lithuania, they, they were announced to be a separate country.",sv
164350,B,"But, yet, the, the government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people",sv
164351,B,and the U. S. didn't go in there and try to save those people.,sv
164352,A,Right.,b
164353,B,"You know. It's like you're not going to go in there and say no,",sv
164354,B,"listen,",^q
164355,B,there's a separate country.,^q
164356,B,"Why,",qh
164357,B,because you're going into the border.,sv

164360,B,Right.,b
164361,B,"Once you get into the border, then there's a threat.",sv
164362,B,"But what happens is you don't mess with us, we won't mess with you,",sv
164363,B,but let's mess with the neutral countries.,sv
164364,A,"Uh-huh,",aa
164365,A,uh-huh.,aa
164366,B,"You know, and now it's like you know, they're saying other people were, were I guess, other leaders were still crazier about it, you know,",sv
164367,B,"like other people, you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there,",sv

164374,A,uh-huh.,aa
164375,B,"You know, but I think, I think the thing is, is that there, the thing",%
164376,B,"like they were saying they go, you know,",sd
164377,B,"like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button. But not the U S S R,",sv
164378,A,Right.,b
164379,B,The U S S R wouldn't do it. Because they got too much at stake.,sv
164380,A,Uh-huh.,b
164381,A,Uh-huh.,b
164382,A,"But I guess there was concern, uh, that Iraq would use, you know, nonconventional warheads with, with the chemical weapons and things",sv
164383,A,but yet it didn't happen.,sd
164384,B,Yeah.,b
164385,A,I mean why not.,qh
164386,B,"Well, My, my point of view to that is, is that it would have had so much, I mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had.",sv
164387,B,"I mean the first, you can imagine the first, uh, chemical weapon used",sv
164388,A,Uh-huh.,b
164389,B,"that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within, you know, three hours of when the weapon was shot.",sv
164390,A,"Oh, so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it.",bf
164391,B,Right.,aa
164392,A,"But, yet the,",%
164393,B,"And what happens is, what happens is,",%
164394,B,"suppose they get Saddam Hussein, which they eventually will,",qh
164395,B,he's got one less thing to go against him.,sv
164396,A,"Uh-huh,",aa
164397,A,uh-huh.,aa

164399,A,Uh-huh.,b
164400,B,"But the U. S. also makes a lot of, uh, you know, treaties with other people like saying, okay,",sv

164407,A,I don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet.,sv
164408,B,Uh no.,aa
164409,B,No.,aa
164410,A,"I think that's, that's, that's not very likely.",sv
164411,A,"But yet you know, as, as the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people.",sv
164412,B,Yeah.,b
164413,A,"And I guess that makes sense what you said that, uh, within their own borders they feel freer to do what, what they feel necessary.",aa
164414,B,Right.,b
164415,B,Right.,b
164416,A,Yeah.,b
164417,B,"And, uh, you know, there's, there's just, you know,",%

164421,B,That's my thing.,sd
164422,B,"I don't believe that anybody should die you know,",sv
164423,A,Uh-huh.,b
164424,B,"and so then, you know, you have,",%
164425,B,"because what happens is,",sv
164426,B,"suppose I'm, I go to war",sv
164427,B,and I'm holding a gun,sv
164428,B,and I'm just looking at myself holding a gun,sv
164429,B,"and whoever shoots first survives, you know.",sv
164430,B,But that same person also has a family,sv
164431,B,"and, you know his parents are going to cry",sv
164432,A,Right.,b

164436,B,"I think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't,",sv
164437,B,"but it's pretty hard to think that, you know, people are just going to shoot each other down",sv
164438,B,and it's legal in a situation like that.,sv
164439,A,"Well or that, that it resolves anything in the end. That that negotiations couldn't resolve.",sv
164440,B,You know.,b
164441,B,Yeah.,b
164442,B,"Yeah,",aa
164443,B,"I mean, I mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous",sv
164444,B,"and he, all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so and keep his power,",sv
164445,A,Uh-huh,b

166021,A,people are getting pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues.,sv

166023,B,"Well, thus far it's working to my advantage.",sd

166032,A,make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education,sv
166033,A,"and save specialization, I guess, for graduate school, unless they're sure they want, early on they want to do something like engineering or something.",sv

166094,A,"but, but by the end, everyone had a good sample of, of, of, sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically, you know,",sd
166095,A,"and, uh, and that sort of forced them.",sd
166096,A,"But I believe that, that, that you, one of the, one of the best things to do, at least for me in school was, was, I was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses.",sv
166097,A,"Um, I was forced to take, I think you know, some sort of art history course,",sd
166098,A,"and we all grumbled about it at first,",sd
166099,A,"but then, afterward, we all wound up taking extra art history classes, because it just seemed like something, something we didn't totally know nothing about, but just enjoyed very much doing,  and something I would never would have done if, if I wasn't forced to take it.",sd
166100,B,"Yes, I  I remember that experience",sd

166103,A,Yes.,b
166104,A,Uh-huh.,b

166108,A,"They just, you know, they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take,",sd

168576,B,"See, well, you, I don't do it either",sd

168579,B,Yeah.,b
168580,B,"Yes,",aa
168581,B,"exactly,",aa

168584,A,"Yeah,",b
168585,A,"you know, enough for a phone call",sd
168586,A,and that's about all.,sd

168590,A,and I think that's terrible.,sv
168591,B,"Yeah,",aa
168592,B,"because it's really, it helps your, if you have good credit, you know, it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a  bigger purchase or something.",sv
168593,A,"Oh, yeah.",b
168594,A,"Yeah,",aa

168597,B,"Yeah,",aa
168598,B,"and I think it's more convenient, too, in a lot of cases,",sv
168599,B,"like whenever we go on trips, we always, you know, use our, our Visa or our Mastercard or whatever.",sd
168600,A,Yeah.,b

168602,A,"Uh-huh,",b
168603,A,uh-huh.,b
168604,B,"and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it,",sd

168606,A,"Uh-huh,",b
168607,A,"uh-huh,",b
168608,A,uh-huh.,b
168609,A,"Yeah,",b
168610,A,"well, I think it's better to use credit cards, too, like I say, because there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing",sv
168611,B,"Oh, yeah.",b
168612,A,"and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket, they're going to hit you over the head.",sv

168614,B,"even if it's five bucks, even.",sv
168615,A,I know.,aa
168616,A,"It just, uh, you know, it just seems like they're, somebody's always watching.",sv

168618,A,"I'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off, you know.",sd
168619,B,Yeah.,b
168620,B,"And also, if you, if someone did happen to steal your credit card, my husband was saying that if, you know, you notice it within, I think it's twenty-four hours, you can report it in,",sd
168621,B,"and I, he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel, you know, whatever payments you had,",sd
168622,B,"and if whoever tried to, uh, you know, credit it to the hilt, you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it,",sd
168623,A,Right.,b

169151,A,"I'm finding that more and more people that I talk to, there's less and less family time available to them.",sd

169153,A,"So, you know, if you do have any time, it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done, uh, just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then, plus try to have that relationship with your children,",sv

169170,A,Yeah,aa
169171,A,Sure.,aa
169172,A,Exactly.,aa

169189,A,"Sure,",b
169190,A,sure.,b

169206,A,I think so too.,aa
169207,A,"In fact, uh, I spent the first three years at home with my daughter,",sd
169208,A,"so I, I guess I felt fairly fortunate that I was able to do that.",sd
169209,A,And I did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare,sd
169210,A,"and I thought to myself, how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks,",sv
169211,A,"whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work, whether it be six weeks or three or four.",sv

169214,A,"this, uh, you need this job.",^q
169215,A,It's a little bit financial type thing,sv
169216,A,"because, uh, if you look all over in the other countries, like Europe and that, uh, their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are",sv
169217,A,and  that's part of it too.,sv
169218,B,Right.,b
169219,A,"But, uh, like my husband was saying, maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties, uh, were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision, well, jeez, you know, I'll go out and get a part-time job.",sv
169220,A,Got a part-time job,sv

169223,A,and  it's nice,sv
169224,B,Right.,b
169225,A,"and really women, past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too, uh,",sv

169235,A,"and, uh, it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it",sd
169236,A,"and pretty soon, you know, you're at the limit where you've got to say okay, you've sacrificed for, you know, so many years at home",sv
169237,A,"and you're not getting any further, you know, along",sv
169238,B,Right.,b
169239,A,and you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go back to work full-time,sv

169241,A,and it's a tough one.,sv
169242,B,Right.,aa
169243,B,"I think  one of the things that people look at too though, is, uh, how they spend their time with their children",sv
169244,A,"And I,",%

169251,A,"Should,",%
169252,B,"Um, I like the idea of nursing homes as a, as a growing the choices you have in nursing homes now, whereas used to, you used to have only, you put, you know,",sv
169253,B,"when, when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves",sv
169254,A,Uh-huh.,b
169255,B,and there was no other choice.,sv
169256,B,"You couldn't take them in your own home,",sv
169257,B,then they went into a nursing home.,sv
169258,B,"You know, maybe you lived too far away to care for them,",sv
169259,A,Right.,b
169260,B,or your daily job or whatever prevented it.,sv
169261,B,"But, um, I like the choices you have now, where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some, basically have a independent life-style, but assisted care.",sd
169262,A,Yeah.,b
169263,B,"And then if things deteriorate, they can go to a second level which is, you know, like, where they prepare their meals for them",sv
169264,A,Uh-huh.,b
169265,B,"and, and they still live somewhat independently",sv
169266,B,but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals.,sv
169267,A,Uh-huh.,b
169268,B,"And then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level, which is full care, you know, where some people can't, where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed,",sv
169269,A,Uh-huh.,b
169270,B,and they can't get around,sv
169271,B,but then they have full care.,sv
169272,B,"But I really like those, those options now,",sd
169273,B,"and, and I think about it more often because my husband's parents are, they're very active right now,",sd
169274,B,"but they're seventy-five and, and seventy-two.",sd
169275,B,"So, that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as I see these things because of their age.",sd
169276,A,Uh-huh.,b
169277,A,Yes.,b
169278,A,"Um, it's, it's funny",sv
169279,A,"because, um, I know people at, that are in all three, and people that work, you know,",sd
169280,A,I know someone that works in all three different stages like you said.,sd
169281,B,Uh-huh.,b
169282,A,"And I have known, you know, people close to me that have been in all three,",sd
169283,A,"and I have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment building,",sd
169284,A,"they, we call it, um,",%
169285,A,"well, we have high rises,",sd
169286,A,"and it's just for elderly people, you know,",sd
169287,A,"or most of, most of, one of their spouses has already passed away.",sd
169288,B,Uh-huh.,b
169289,A,"And it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age, and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through.",sd
169290,B,Uh-huh.,b
169291,A,"And, it's, it's really nice to go and see them, you know, where they can still get around and everything,",sd
169292,A,"and they still, you know, do their own thing,",sd
169293,A,"but it's, it's really nice to see them because,",sd
169294,A,"I mean sometimes,",%
169295,A,"like I had a great aunt,",sd
169296,A,"she lived with us for, um, three months, and, because she's starting to get Alzheimer's disease.",sd
169297,A,"And I know I have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters,",sd
169298,A,"and I know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to, to actually sit down, because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing.",sd
169299,B,Right.,b
169300,A,"And to actually sit,",sd
169301,A,so it's really nice to see that.,sv
169302,B,"Yeah,",aa
169303,B,"that's some of the things I would find important before I, I would look into that for a person, is, is, is like you're saying, a good mix of people who have the same interests.",sv
169304,A,Uh-huh.,b
169305,B,"And, uh, and the programs,",sd
169306,B,"here they have different, uh, besides just different levels within the same program, they have different types of programs.",sd
169307,B,They have several areas.,sd
169308,B,"They have one area in town where the people,",sd
169309,B,I guess a lot of it comes with money.,sd
169310,B,"I, this, this one area is a bit more expensive,",sd
169311,B,and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life.,sd
169312,B,"But, but things that people where they have similar interests.",sd
169313,A,Uh-huh.,b
169314,B,"Like you're saying,",sd
169315,B,"and the programs that they have, where, where some of them will have dances once a week",sd
169316,A,Yeah.,b
169317,B,"and some of them sponsor different crafts,",sd
169318,B,"and they go to the arboretum to see things,",sd
169319,B,"and they make sure that if they want to go to church, there's a bus there.",sd
169320,A,Uh-huh.,b
169321,B,"And, it'll, or, you know, or someone will transport them to a specific church, even though it's, you know, maybe it's thirty minutes away,",sd
169322,B,"because it's a big, you know, Dallas area is a big metropolitan area.",sd
169323,A,Yeah,b
169324,B,"But a lot of these places have, have churches or have, have individual transportation.",sd
169325,B,"That's, that's something I'd look for, something that would make me happy personally if I had to live there.",sd
169326,A,Uh-huh.,b
169327,B,"Because I don't think a lot of people really, even in the nice ones, and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently, they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home.",sv
169328,A,Yeah.,b
169329,A,Uh-huh.,b
169330,B,"So I think those kinds of things, to make it more homelike and to make it more, um, enjoyable for them. That'd, that'd be one thing I'd look for, along with the, uh, health care aspects to make sure they had, you know, that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses.",sv
169331,A,Uh-huh.,b
169332,A,Yeah.,aa
169333,A,"Um, I'm in college,",sd
169334,A,"and I'm, I'm only twenty-one",sd
169335,A,"but we had a I had a speech class last semester,",sd
169336,A,and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly.,sd
169337,B,Uh-huh.,b
169338,A,"And I was so surprised to hear how many people,",sd
169339,A,"like whenever they're in, you know, the older people, they're like, um, fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they, you know, they wander the halls. And they get the wrong medicine, just because, you know, the, the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine.",sv
169340,B,Uh-huh.,b
169341,B,Yeah.,b
169342,A,"And so many of them, you know, are,",sv
169343,B,"Are overmedicated, too.",^2
169344,A,Yes.,aa
169345,A,"And it was, it was awful to hear what, you know, what some of these people really went through.",sd
169346,A,"And I forget the percentage of people that, you know, that she had said,",sd
169347,A,"and this was, I mean, she did research on it and everything.",sd
169348,B,Uh-huh.,b
169349,B,"Yeah,",b
169350,B,"that's one of the things that, that we don't think about as we get older, and the, the money that it now requires to, uh, be in one of these places.",sv
169351,B,"Because some of these people that are just on social security,",sv
169352,B,"and if they don't have any living relatives,",sv
169353,B,perhaps they never had children,sv
169354,B,"or if their children, you know, passed away before they did they can be in some places that are, you know, that, that are not good.",sv
169355,A,Uh-huh.,b
169356,A,Yeah.,b
169357,B,"Or they, they have very minimum, minimal care",sv
169358,B,"and the, the care that they are getting, the people who are giving it are are paid at a minimum wage,",sv
169359,B,and they just they don't care as much.,sv
169360,A,Yeah.,b
169361,B,"And, and like you said, they're trying to make it, the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything.",sv
169362,A,Uh-huh.,b
169363,B,"That certainly would be something to, to watch for.",sv
169364,B,"Because you've got, with some of them being, some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in, .",sv
169365,A,"I know,",aa
169366,A,"and and sometimes they share a room,",sv
169367,A,"and it's just a little cubbyhole,",sv
169368,B,Yeah.,b
169369,A,"and they share it with another person,",sv
169370,A,and they're still paying that much.,sv
169371,B,"Oh, yeah,",aa
169372,B,"so you've,",%
169373,A,"It, it, it just sometimes, it just seems ridiculous.",sv
169374,B,"Yeah,",aa
169375,B,"you've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care, what kind of level of care you need, and then what you can, unfortunately what you can afford at the same time.",sv
169376,A,"Uh-huh,",aa
169377,A,"uh-huh,",aa
169378,A,yeah.,aa
169379,A,"Um, I've been lucky,",sd
169380,A,"well, my mom's, um, parents, they're both in their, in their, uh, eighties,",sd
169381,A,and I was just home for spring break,sd
169382,A,"and my grandma said something to me about, she goes, well maybe we'll just sell the house.",sd

169386,A,"no,",^q
169387,A,stay in the house as long as you can.,^q
169388,B,"Well, like there are other communities, too, that aren't necessarily a nursing home.",sv
169389,B,"I had an aunt who lived in a small town in Texas that, um, was in a,",sd
169390,B,"it was a, it was a housing division.",sd
169391,B,"Each person had their own little bitty house that they had built,",sd

169394,B,"their, they were, most of them were on social security,",sd
169395,B,and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government.,sd
169396,B,"But it was this little bitty one bedroom house,",sd
169397,B,"but it was a separate house,",sd
169398,B,"and they had a living room, and a bedroom and a kitchen, and a bathroom.",sd
169399,A,Oh.,b
169400,B,"So they still had, they had, and they had people who came in who, um, supervised, all these houses,",sd
169401,B,were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block.,sd
169402,A,Uh-huh.,b
169403,B,"And they had a, a supervisory, um,",sd
169404,B,"wasn't a house, really,",sd
169405,B,"it was, it was more like, um, a headquarters or something, anyway, where they, they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone, if they needed someone, they could ring",sd
169406,A,"It sounds like, uh, an apartment or",sv
169407,B,"and, and someone, could come to their house.",sd
169408,A,Oh.,b
169409,A,Yeah.,b
169410,B,"And that, and they always cooked,",sd
169411,B,"then they had, they had the choice, you know,",sd
169412,B,they lived in their own little house.,sd
169413,A,Uh-huh.,b
169414,B,"They had their own possessions still in there, to some you know, some of them.",sd
169415,A,Uh-huh.,b
169416,B,"And they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to, and their own dinner,",sd

169420,B,"They had people who did the yard,",sd
169421,B,"and they had a maid that, uh, uh, service that came in and cleaned everybody's house.",sd
169422,B,So they didn't have to worry about that.,sd
169423,A,"Oh, yeah.",b
169424,B,"And it was really a nice, it was really a nice compromise, especially, because she felt like she was still living in her own house.",sd
169425,A,Uh-huh.,b
169426,B,"And she still had her own couch, and her own bed,",sd
169427,B,"and it, it really helped a lot,",sd

169696,A,"So, it's kind of like they don't, you know.",sd
169697,B,"Well sometimes I think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though, you know.",sv
169698,B,I mean you don't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody,sv
169699,A,"I, I think they do.",aa
169700,A,Uh-huh.,b
169701,B,"so you, you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself, if you really want it.",sv
169702,A,Exactly.,aa

169705,B,Uh-huh.,b
169706,A,"You know, I would work in the summer,",sd

169718,B,how easy it is to blow money you earn.,sv

169723,A,"She goes, okay if your going to blow your money on other things, she goes, you can just pay for your life insurance.",sd

169726,A,"we're still, like I'm still covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because I'm still in school,",sd

169731,A,and then I pay for my own life insurance too.,sd
169732,B,"Wow, you've really got responsibilities.",sv

169734,B,Yeah.,b
169735,A,"Because my mom said, that's silly to let one of the older one's drive it,",sd
169736,A,"if we were in a wreck, you know, you can be sued for anything now.",sv
169737,A,And she said that's really not fair to the younger kids.,sd
169738,A,If we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued,sv

171631,A,"and, uh, that was a you know, a sedan,",sd
171632,A,"and, uh, we got that.",sd
171633,A,"The major things,",%
171634,A,"the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova,",sd

171637,A,"my son was driving,",sd
171638,A,"and someone came into his lane and hit him,",sd

171644,B,Um.,b
171645,A,"So I mean, I got, I was getting really nervous,",sd
171646,A,"so I finally said, we, I want a really solid car.",sd
171647,A,So we found the Audi second hand.,sd
171648,A,"I guess right now my criteria for cars is, uh, of being solid, able to take an impact",sd

171651,B,Uh-huh,b
171652,A,But the things that I would want would be a solid car.,sd

171654,B,Right.,b
171655,A,"Uh, our, our van, which is a, a delight to drive, does not have,",sd
171656,A,"I think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just, are terrible.",sv

171664,B,"Well, it's,",%
171665,B,"I didn't really need power windows, but it has power, you know, windows and steering and air conditioning,",sd
171666,A,Yeah.,b

171668,A,"I guess down here air conditioning's a must, isn't it.",qy
171669,B,"Uh-huh,",ny
171670,B,"oh, yeah.",ny
171671,B,It has a stereo and a cassette player,sd

171674,A,That's incredible.,ba
171675,B,Uh-huh.,b
171676,A,That is incredible.,ba
171677,B,So.,%
171678,A,"Uh, we, we get about, our, the van gets, on highways, can get about twenty-eight.",sd
171679,A,The Audi does not have good mileage.,sd
171680,A,That's the one drawback.,sd
171681,A,"It's a powerful car. Um, but it does not, uh,",sd
171682,B,Uh-huh.,b
171683,A,"I mean, I, if I'm on a highway and I can get twenty, twenty-one miles per gallon, I consider that I'm lucky.",sd
171684,A,"Maybe, maybe sometimes I've gotten twenty-two.",sd
171685,A,It comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving,sd
171686,B,Uh-huh.,b
171687,A,"and that's a, to me is a real drawback.",sv
171688,A,"I wish I would, you know, I could settle for twenty-eight,",sd
171689,A,"but, uh, the, uh, the frills on that car are nice, but they're not necessary, for me except air conditioning.",sd
171690,B,Uh-huh.,b
171691,A,"In this area, uh, in Washington D C area, it gets hot and humid.",sd
171692,B,"Uh-huh,",b
171693,B,it's really humid.,sd
171694,A,"Yeah,",aa
171695,A,"uh, so air conditioning is uh, definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer.",sd
171696,A,"Um, but I, uh, I, I don't need, uh, you know,",sd
171697,A,"power windows are nice, but I don't need them Although I must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads, come into a toll road, you just push that button down,",sd
171698,B,Right.,b
171699,A,"it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up, instead of having to crank it.",sd
171700,B,"Crank,",%
171701,B,yeah.,b
171702,A,"Yeah,",b

171704,A,"if you're alone in the car just to press buttons, and.",sd
171705,B,Right.,b
171706,B,You don't have to stretch.,^2
171707,A,"But you know, I've lived all these years without them,",sd
171708,A,I probably could have lived a little longer,sd
171709,B,That's true.,ba
171710,A,"Uh, one of the things that we have, uh, we've liked when we gotten a new car, and this, this used car has it, is a sun roof",sd
171711,B,Uh-huh.,b
171712,A,and those are really nice in good weather.,sv
171713,B,That's right.,ba
171714,A,"So, so I guess if we get a new car, it definitely would have to have anti lock brakes,",sd
171715,A,"I'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof, and, uh, just so it'd be a good solid car.",sd
171716,B,Uh-huh.,b
171717,A,I guess that those are my major criteria.,sd
171718,A,"Everything else is, you know, a luxury,",sv
171719,A,"and they, make the car more expensive, but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong.",sv
171720,B,Right.,b
171721,A,"So, uh, if you were to buy a new car now, a brand new car, what would you look for?",qw
171722,B,"Um, like you said, anti-lock brakes and air bag,",sd
171723,B,"and, uh, I'd, I'd really like to have a car that's dependable that, that you drive, you know, like a American made car that's as dependable as Mercedes or somebody, you know that's,",sd
171724,A,"Yeah,",b
171725,A,yeah.,b
171726,A,Isn't that true.,bh

171729,B,Uh-huh.,b
171730,A,"Yeah,",b
171731,A,"sometimes, one advantage of an American made car, is if you get stuck anywhere, most local garages can fix you up.",sv
171732,B,"Yeah,",b
171733,B,"they have parts,",sd
171734,B,uh-huh.,b
171735,A,"But once you get, if you, once you get something fancy, you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really,",sv
171736,B,"Right,",b
171737,A,"and the parts, I know the Audi parts are terribly expensive.",sd
171738,B,Uh-huh.,b
171739,A,"I mean, it",%
171740,A,I shudder.,sd
171741,A,"I would not get the Audi again, just for that reason.",sd

171743,A,"You know, we certainly have the technology,",sv
171744,B,Right.,b
171745,A,"but, it's amazing,",sv

171749,A,"Uh, if,",%
171750,A,you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic,sv
171751,B,Uh-huh.,b

171754,A,I don't think I have to give up as much as I'm giving up.,sv

171842,A,And I wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company,sd
171843,B,Yeah.,b

172635,A,Go ahead.,ad
172636,B,"Well, uh, a friend of mine actually works for McDonald Douglas in the, uh, in the space station program",sd
172637,B,so I get to find out a lot of information about what's going on there,sd
172638,A,Oh.,b

172650,A,Sure.,b
172651,B,So. I suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that.,sv
172652,A,"Oh, that's good because sometimes I wonder, you know, being a, uh, lay person out there of not, uh, knowing exactly what's going on in space. Whether, you know, they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not",sd
172653,A,we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here.,sd

172668,A,Let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here.,sv
172669,A,"Mainly because, uh,",%
172670,A,the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us.,sv
172671,A,I mean this is it.,sv

172681,B,"Well, uh, as far as the practical aspects go, I suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise between, you know, deep space I'm sorry, deep space exploration and, uh, and not doing anything because we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station.",sd

172797,B,Yeah.,b

172834,B,I mean if I miss something big deal,sd
172835,A,Yes.,b
172836,A,"Well, and things are repeated, so often that you know if, if I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show if I ever decide to tune it in again,",sv

172855,B,Uh-huh.,b
172856,A,"And you could say, oh, that's a good program for them because it's educational",sd

179342,A,It took four days.,sd

183344,B,What can we do about crime?,qw
183345,B,I don't know.,h
183346,B,"The one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're, they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people",sd
183347,B,"and they keep letting out people that have, you know, these horrible records.",sv
183348,A,Uh-huh.,b
183349,B,So maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something.,sv
183350,B,That's one thing I guess I could think of,sv
183351,A,Uh-huh.,b
183352,B,"Uh, it's definitely a big concern,",sv
183353,B,"I mean every day it's, you know, all",%
183354,B,"we live in a little small town,",sd

183366,B,Yeah.,b
183367,A,"Unless they start enforcing the, uh,",sv

183369,A,"like: t, t, t, t, uh, start giving more people death sentences.",sv
183370,A,That's the only thing I can think of.,sv
183371,B,Yeah.,b
183372,B,"Yeah,",b
183373,B,well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous.,sv
183374,B,"I mean you hear about people, you know, six and seven times have committed burglaries",sv
183375,B,"and they're still, you know, only serving six months in prison.",sv
183376,B,So that's definitely something.,sv
183377,B,"They could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like, you know, from one month to ten years or something",sv
183378,A,Uh-huh.,b
183379,B,"That would be one thing that, you know, I think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties, you know, for certain crimes",sv

183389,A,"Um, I'm a senior at Clarion University.",na
183390,B,"Oh, okay.",bk
183391,B,"Because one of the things that I've heard so much about um, lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much.",sd
183392,B,"And apparently many of the, especially like in date rape, many of the, uh, you know, perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up.",sd

183395,A,"You know, what I mean?",qy
183396,B,Wow.,ba
183397,A,A lot of times the girls don't even report it.,sd

183404,A,"Uh, but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not.",sv
183405,B,Yeah.,b
183406,B,They say like only one in ten are reported.,sd
183407,B,I believe it.,sv
183408,A,Uh-huh.,b
183409,B,That's awful.,ba
183410,B,So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it.,sv
183411,B,I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing.,sd
183412,B,"But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, you know, for people to report it.",sv
183413,A,Uh-huh.,b
183414,B,So that's probably something else they could do.,sv
183415,A,Yeah.,b
183416,B,"I don't know,",h
183417,B,"it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs, you know.",sv
183418,B,"And that's like as long as,",%
183419,B,"it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, you know,",sd
183420,B,because these kids are saying why should I go to high school,sv
183421,B,"and so I can go out and work at Burger King, you know, for four dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs.",^q
183422,B,So that's certainly a big problem.,sv
183423,B,I don't know what the solution to that is.,sv
183424,B,Having more drug treatment centers available.,sv
183425,B,"Jeez, I don't know.",h
183426,A,"Uh. See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything.",sv
183427,B,Yeah.,b
183428,A,I know a lot of people that partake in that.,sd
183429,A,"And I'm not saying they're bad people,",sd
183430,A,"but I, I, I would say that's a bigger problem.",sv
183431,B,Yeah.,b
183432,B,"Because it ends up,",%
183433,B,"even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, you know,",sv
183434,B,"huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, you know, on higher and higher up, on drugs,",sv
183435,A,Uh-huh.,b
183436,B,and it's definitely got to do with crime.,sv
183437,B,"You know, you hear about people selling their babies, you know, to get some crack.",sv
183438,B,"I mean, just, oh,",%
183439,B,"gosh, horrible stuff like that.",sv
183440,B,"One of the things they're doing is, is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack.",sd

183442,B,"They said, uh, some of the statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack,",sd
183443,B,and their moms are crack users.,sd
183444,B,"So that's, you know, another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal, you know, for doing that to her child.",sv
183445,A,Uh-huh.,b
183446,B,So I don't know who's the victim there.,sd
183447,B,"I mean the kids are the victim, it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted.",sv

183525,B,and it's okay,sv

183541,B,and they both have to work,sv

183855,A,"Of course, she looks at what she brings home each week.",sd

183937,B,You said you owned one.,sd
183938,A,I sold my house.,ng

185108,B,Yes.,b
185109,A,"and, so, uh, news stations always tell the story from a certain angle",sv

185113,B,"Yeah,",b

185192,A,Uh-huh.,b
185193,B,"But I think that, I think that, that from a, a justice standpoint, because we have the option of not watching that station.",sv
185194,A,Uh-huh.,b
185195,B,"Uh, I'm not sure I, I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs",sv
185196,B,"but I think that, uh, in some cases this should be some real opportunity and, and some diversity, and and this kind of thing",sv
185197,A,Yeah.,b
185198,B,"and I think that, Dallas, it turns out, though from what I understand, has quite good,",sd
185199,B,I occasionally go to Saint Louis.,sd
185200,A,Uh-huh.,b
185201,B,"And, uh, there for a few days and watch the news and, and think Dallas really does have, have quite good news.",sv

185205,B,Course he pumping his own,sd

185209,B,Where'd you move from?,qw
185210,A,Houston.,sd

185213,A,"I guess because you get use to, you like the anchors,",sd
185214,B,Yeah.,b
185215,A,and you feel comfortable with them,sd
185216,A,"and,",b
185217,B,"It is interesting though,",sv
185218,B,it becomes a little of personality.,sv
185219,B,"In fact, the, the guy that was on, the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, oh, long time ago, twenty years or so, even longer than that. Twenty-one, twenty-three years ago or so, twenty-four, anyway long time ago",sv
185220,A,Uh-huh.,b
185221,B,"and, and shortly after I got, we got here fourteen years ago",sd
185222,B,"and, uh, they had, they had fired him, uh, because he was too",sd
185223,B,"anyway, didn't, he didn't have the personality, and wasn't drawing the crowds",sd
185224,A,Uh-huh.,b
185225,B,and that's interesting.,sv
185226,B,"That's, that's what the T V stations do.",sv
185227,B,they're trying to get ratings.,sv
185228,A,That's true.,ba
185229,B,"And I think, if we remember that, that they're out after the ratings.",sv
185230,A,Their job.,^2
185231,A,That's true.,ba
185232,A,So that really effects how they report the news.,sv
185233,B,"Well, it's like the, the Dale Hansen on channel eight is a, sometimes a little too cutesy",sd
185234,B,"but, I wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes.",sd
185235,A,"Is he the sports,",qy
185236,B,"Have you talked, have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes?",qy

185251,B,So you have to do the random drug testing.,qy^d

185254,A,yeah.,ny
185255,A,"In fact with me, this is, it's not much to talk about,",sd
185256,A,I'm so much for it.,sd
185257,A,I don't really have much to comment about it.,sd
185258,A,There've been some interesting subject that they've called about.,sv
185259,A,"How many times have you called,",qw
185260,A,or have you been participating in this?,qrr
185261,B,"Oh, about ten or eleven calls.",sd

185263,A,"well you, you've passed me up.",sd
185264,B,Right.,b
185265,A,This is about six times.,sd
185266,B,Oh.,b
185267,B,"As contract person we have to do random drug testing, too.",sd
185268,A,Yeah.,b
185269,B,It doesn't bother me.,sd
185270,B,I don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything.,sd
185271,A,"No,",aa
185272,A,I think it's good.,sv
185273,A,"In fact, I don't know what the statistics were,",sd
185274,A,but I think that they were surprised to find it so low.,sd
185275,A,"I think they were expecting to find, uh, like the national average at T I.",sd
185276,A,And I think it was tremendously down.,sd
185277,B,"As far as the number of drug users, you mean?",qy
185278,A,Yeah,ny
185279,B,Huh.,b
185280,A,as far as the number of people they actually found that were drug users.,sd
185281,A,"But I think that on when I was at T I of course, we had all the information before they started.",sd
185282,B,Right.,b
185283,A,And they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs.,sd
185284,A,"And I think that's what helps, you know, that in the warning that you have a drug program, the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs, actually go",sv
185285,A,and then usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything.,sv
185286,B,"Right,",b
185287,B,"yeah,",b
185288,B,so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee.,sv
185289,A,"Yeah,",b
185290,A,and our numbers have been way down.,sd
185291,A,I don't know what they were.,sd
185292,B,"When I worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person,",sd
185293,B,"and so we had,",%
185294,B,"when we sent temporaries to T I, we had to have their drug tested.",sd
185295,A,Yeah.,b
185296,B,"And we did have a couple of cases where we really, the person said that they hadn't used anything,",sd
185297,B,"and their test came back positive,",sd
185298,B,and normally we didn't retest them.,sd
185299,B,But there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth,sd
185300,B,"and we retested them like the next day,",sd
185301,B,and they came back negative the second time.,sd
185302,A,"Oh, really.",b
185303,B,"So that, that's the only thing, I think, that might be a little bit of a problem.",sv
185304,A,"Oh, you're,",%
185305,A,"that's a good point,",sv
185306,A,"but at T I they, before they had the testing, I've forgotten, seems like it's a year ago September, something like that, they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government.",sd
185307,A,"And, of course, that's critical, just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to be, you know, have a lot of quality control, that they keep track of everything.",sd
185308,A,They don't make mistakes.,sd
185309,A,That would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive,sv
185310,B,Right.,b
185311,A,and they were not.,sd
185312,A,"And I haven't heard of any,",sd
185313,A,now I'm not in personnel or anything.,sd
185314,B,Yeah.,b
185315,A,"But, uh, they say that there, it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not.",sd
185316,A,"In other words, there's very few mistakes,",sd
185317,A,"and that, of course, has got to be critical.",sd
185318,A,"It's got to be, if you have a drug testing program,",sv
185319,A,"it's got to be with a very, very good agency.",sv
185320,A,You don't just have some local group do it.,sv
185321,A,It's got to be a highly qualified agency.,sv
185322,B,"Right,",b
185323,B,"yeah,",b
185324,B,not just some doctor's office somewhere.,sd
185325,A,"No,",aa
185326,A,you don't want to do that.,sv
185327,A,It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check.,sv
185328,A,And I think that T I is latched themselves up with an established group.,sd
185329,A,"And that would be good for any company that does it, and not to have just a very casual thing.",sv
185330,A,"It's got to be with a, you know, first class, totally independent agency. Not local of course.",sv
185331,A,"Ours, I think, well I think it was in the south somewhere,",sv
185332,A,"but it wasn't even in Dallas, you know, the one that did us.",sd
185333,B,Oh really.,b
185334,A,Yeah.,aa
185335,B,"Huh. Do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive,",qy
185336,B,or do they fire them right away.,qrr
185337,A,"Oh, no.",nn
185338,A,They're not fired.,sd
185339,A,"They are, they have one chance to then go in a program.",sd
185340,A,"You come back positive, you have one chance to go in, and go into, they have a lot of, uh, rehabilitation, both for alcohol and for drug use,",sd
185341,A,"and they have, uh, a lot of, uh, they have an agency where you can go for personal problems, financial or whatever.",sd
185342,B,Right.,b
185343,A,"And so they, they, they don't,",sd
185344,A,"no,",nn
185345,A,it's not firing first.,sd
185346,A,"It's, uh, definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate.",sd
185347,A,"In fact, again, before you go, you know, that's why I said, when they first started it, they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs, go ahead and get rehabilitated first,",sd
185348,A,and they won't say anything about it.,sd
185349,B,Right.,b
185350,B,I think that's really good.,sv
185351,A,Oh sure.,b
185352,B,I know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something.,sd
185353,A,"Oh yeah,",b
185354,A,"no,",aa
185355,A,that's not right.,sv
185356,A,"It's really an illness, or whatever you want to say that it is.",sv
185357,A,"You know, it's a weakness and all,",sv
185358,A,"and who, all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another.",sv
185359,A,"And I think that those people that have that and however they got into it,",sv
185360,A,"I have children,",sd
185361,A,"I always worry about the, the classical thing that you see on T V, where the drug pushers give it to the kids for free, you know, and get them sucked in,",sd
185362,A,and then they sell it to them.,sd
185363,A,You know the classical thing is to give it away.,sd
185364,B,Right.,b
185365,A,I always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party,sd
185366,A,and they slip it to them.,sd
185367,A,"I don't know,",h
185368,A,"I don't even have that much knowledge to know whether that would get them addicted or not, you know.",sd
185369,A,That's a real worry.,sd
185370,B,"Yeah,",b
185371,B,"some of the stories you read about cocaine, that's like people try it one time and they're addicted.",sd

185376,B,I hear a lot of horror stories about things like that.,sd
185377,A,Uh-huh.,b
185378,B,"But most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first,",sd
185379,B,and then they start a drug problem.,sd
185380,A,Yeah.,b
185381,B,"It's usually not a one time accidental thing, I don't think.",sv

185413,B,"If you're not too sure what's going on, he tells parents all the time, haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked.",sd
185414,A,"The key thing that I think, that we try to do, is that bring all the friends over here.",sv

185420,B,"yeah,",b
185421,B,I think that's a really good thing to encourage.,sv

185479,A,"Maybe I've, uh, changed wiper blades or something",sd

185482,A,"I guess, he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows, he knows how to do it,",sd
185483,A,and he'll do it.,sd
185484,A,"So, he, he hates the time that he takes,",sd
185485,A,"but he has changed, um, the brakes",sd
185486,A,and he has done all of the tune-ups,sd
185487,A,and the like that,sd
185488,A,and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car.,sd
185489,A,I was really impressed with that,sd
185490,A,"We had to have it to get the car inspected,",sd
185491,A,it wouldn't pass inspection,sd
185492,A,"and, and so, he priced around",sd
185493,A,and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it,sd
185494,A,"so, he thought, well, I can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars, which he did",sd
185495,A,"and then, he did it",sd
185496,A,"and, so, I guess, uh, he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up,",sd
185497,A,"what, uh, what's your experience been like?",qo
185498,B,"Well, I, uh, I have a long experience with cars.",sd
185499,B,"I, uh, when I was younger, uh, my brother had a Corvette",sd
185500,B,and I bought a Corvette,sd
185501,B,and when you have a Corvette you more or less do all the work,sd
185502,B,"and I've done everything from build the motor from the, uh, you know, the bare block on up.",sd
185503,B,"And, I, I'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car, I hate to go pay somebody good money, you know,",sd
185504,B,I hate to pay somebody twenty-five dollars on hour for something I can do myself.,sd
185505,A,Uh-huh.,b
185506,B,"It just, to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that.",sv
185507,A,Right.,b
185508,B,"In fact, I, um, just this past weekend put new plugs in both, uh, my car an my wife's car.",sd
185509,A,Uh-huh.,b
185510,B,"And so, I, uh, I pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything I can do myself",sd
185511,B,"but I've, I've gotten to the point in my life, um, you know, I just crept over forty years old, where I don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore",sd
185512,A,That makes sense.,ba
185513,B,"I mean it's, um, I don't know whether I've, I've just reached a point, you know,",sd
185514,B,"it's, it's real rough in the winter time.",sd
185515,A,"Huh, yes.",b
185516,B,"And, uh, so, I try to make sure that, uh, by the time fall runs around, because we actually have winters here on the east coast, um, that, uh, I have, you know, the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter",sd
185517,A,Right,b
185518,B,"and, uh, then springtime I usually end up giving them, the, uh, a tune-up and make sure that they're running well,",sd
185519,B,"and, uh, you know, it's like I had the muffler go out on my, on my car, shortly before it was required to go,",sd
185520,B,"in Maryland they have, uh, emission tests.",sd
185521,A,Uh-huh.,b
185522,B,"And you're required to get your car and go through the emission test,",sd
185523,B,"well, my muffler, of course, starting going bad right before I was supposed to go to the emission test,",sd
185524,B,"so. You know, I had to do that job,",sd
185525,B,"and of course, that was back in December when it's nice and cold outside",sd
185526,A,"Yes,",b
185527,A,I'm sure it was.,ba
185528,B,"But the thing was that I could do the job myself,",sd
185529,B,"I mean, the parts cost me, oh, roughly a hundred dollars.",sd
185530,A,Uh-huh.,b
185531,B,"Um, if I'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty-five.",sd
185532,A,Right.,b
185533,B,Now like who's got that extra two and a quarter,qh
185534,B,I know I don't.,sd
185535,A,Yeah.,b
185536,A,"Well, that's exactly the way he feels is that, he really hates to spend the time,",sd
185537,A,it takes a lot of time,sd
185538,A,"if he, if he thinks it's going to be two hours, it's four if, you know, whatever, it always takes him twice as long.",sd
185539,A,"But then when he's finished he's, he always says, well, now you owe me three hundred dollars",sd
185540,A,"And then he thinks that he has the money that, that he can spend on something",sd
185541,A,and he hasn't given it to someone else.,sd
185542,B,Yeah.,b
185543,A,"So, he gets some satisfaction out of that although, generally I think he, he does not look forward to or anticipate,",sd
185544,A,there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars.,sd
185545,A,There's a lot of people,sd
185546,A,and he just isn't one of them.,sd
185547,B,Yeah.,b
185548,B,"I, uh, I don't mind it,",sd
185549,B,"um, there was a time when I had my Corvette,",sd
185550,B,"I mean, of course, I loved it, um,",sd
185551,B,"but if, you know,",%
185552,B,I've got other interests now,sd
185553,B,"and there's a lot, other more important things I think I should be doing with my time.",sd
185554,B,"And I have the same problem,",sd
185555,B,"I mean, you can tell him from me",ad
185556,B,"but it doesn't matter,",sd
185557,B,"I mean, I've, I've had greasy fingernails for years",sd
185558,B,"And it still takes me twice as long as I think it's going to take to do the job,",sd
185559,A,Yeah.,b
185560,B,"so, but, I think the difference is that, uh, when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing,",sd
185561,A,Uh-huh.,b
185562,B,"and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right,",sd
185563,B,"and, you know, I've, I've in the past I've had brake jobs done by someone that when I went back and looked at it some months later I'd find something drastically wrong with it, you know, like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident. You know, those kind of things,",sd
185564,A,Right.,b
185565,A,Right.,b
185566,B,"and when you have a vehicle that's being used by, you know, other members of your family, you know, you don't want that kind of a situation to come up.",sd
185567,A,No.,b
185568,B,"And it's very, very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust.",sv
185569,B,I only have one guy that I know that I trust to work on my car.,sd
185570,A,Uh-huh.,b
185571,B,"And, uh, he's about sixty miles from here.",sd
185572,B,"And so, it,",%
185573,B,"and if I have something that's really major that I can't handle or feel I don't have the time to handle, I'll take it to him to do it.",sd
185574,A,"Right,",b
185575,A,"you know, that it's, uh , really has a bad reputation is to feel that, that people in general feel and have, have rightly so, I think been cheated many times,",sd
185576,A,"and, um, and well, I know once when we had a,",sd
185577,A,we usually inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car,sd
185578,A,"but, um, once the muffler needed to be changed",sd
185579,A,"and, uh, he had looked at him himself",sd
185580,A,"and, but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change",sd
185581,A,"he said, that's really, really good",sd
185582,A,"so, he went in",sd
185583,A,"and, uh, but when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something.",sd
185584,A,"Anyway, but the car that the muffler people had, um, my, at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further, you know,",sd
185585,A,"they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever,",sd
185586,B,Uh-huh.,b
185587,A,"and so, since then, I don't think he's ever even seriously considered a, you know, any kind of job he thought he could do himself.",sd
185588,A,"But, I know from his childhood, he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment, I guess.",sd
185589,A,"And, um, so, Kelly growing up, he, he felt like that, that was a good way on Saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father.",sd
185590,B,Uh-huh.,b
185591,A,"And so, he used, they used car repairs kind of as a way to have a, you know, something that they did together,",sd
185592,B,Uh-huh.,b
185593,B,Yeah.,b
185594,A,"and he thought that turned out pretty good because it, you know, it helped him to understand and be functional now,",sd
185595,A,"and it helped him to have a close relationship,",sd
185596,A,"so, that's one, one way he looked at it.",sd
185597,B,Yeah.,b
185598,B,"that's probably, uh, uh, something that, uh, is, is you know, is good for both of them.",sd
185599,B,"I know that, uh, my older son I could never get him interested in cars",sd

185604,A,Uh-huh.,b
185605,B,"I mean he, he just would not have anything to do with them.",sd
185606,B,"And, uh, later on and like when he, you know, grew up, got out of the house, got his own car, um, he didn't know how to do anything to it. I mean, absolutely nothing.",sd
185607,B,"I mean, he couldn't even check the oil.",sd
185608,B,"I mean, that's, that's how uninformed he was and disinterested.",sd
185609,A,Uh-huh.,b
185610,B,"And, I guess there are some people out there like that, um, you know,",sd
185611,B,"I always thought maybe, you know, if he took more of an interest and, you know, what I was doing",sd
185612,B,and maybe we could have communicated better.,sd

185616,A,"Yeah,",b
185617,A,it didn't always work.,sd

185619,A,"I don't feel the need to, um, you know, be a feminist on that issue and say I can take care of my own things.",sd
185620,A,"I'm, I'm happy to let them run the cars because I have so, many other responsibilities that, um,",sd

185629,A,"It's a good experience,",ba

188787,A,Sure.,b
188788,B,"and, uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many C F C into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, you know,",sd

188790,A,Yeah.,b
188791,A,Sure,b
188792,B,"But,",%
188793,A,"uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, I'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it",sv

188795,B,Right.,b
188796,A,but it's uncomfortable,sv

188804,B,"It's probably happened to millions of people,",sv
188805,A,"oh, sure,",ba
188806,A,"because if you take it into a service station, they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars",sv
188807,B,Uh-huh.,b
188808,B,Uh-huh.,b

188811,A,"I think it's like three or four dollars a, a can",sd

191435,B,"Um, I'm, I'm relatively satisfied with the benefits I have.",sd
191436,B,"I think that, um, our health insurance is terribly expensive.",sd
191437,A,Uh-huh.,b
191438,B,I'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money.,sd
191439,B,"But, um, you know, that's, that's my major complaints, I guess.",sd
191440,B,What about you?,qo
191441,A,"Yeah,",ny
191442,A,and a lot of times they turn down your claims,sd
191443,A,so that leaves you paying for all of it.,sd
191444,B,Uh-huh.,b
191445,B,"Or, or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't.",sv
191446,A,Uh-huh.,b
191447,A,Yeah.,aa
191448,A,Right,aa
191449,A,"the  health insurance I have is Met Life,",sd
191450,B,"Yeah,",b
191451,A,"and, if,",%
191452,A,"it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then, uh, you just pay ten dollars",sd
191453,A,"and then, uh, the insurance pays the rest of the bill.",sd
191454,A,"Or if you go outside you get, uh, seventy thirty.",sd
191455,B,"Now we,",%
191456,B,I have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered,sd
191457,B,"but what I found recently is what they've been doing is they, they poll somehow the area,",sd
191458,B,and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code.,sd
191459,A,Uh-huh.,b
191460,B,"And so recently, when, when we had a claim, um, they didn't pay the eighty-five percent they paid much lower",sd
191461,B,"and when I called they said, Oh well, that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area.",sd
191462,B,"And I was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code, so that, you know, two doctors could balance each other out, or their, you know, their statistics aren't very accurate. *listen",sd
191463,A,Right.,b
191464,A,"And, and they're probably doing it to their benefit, anyway.",sv
191465,A,"So,",%
191466,B,"Yeah,",b
191467,B,"I would assume that you know, whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in.",sv
191468,A,Uh-huh.,b
191469,B,"But it's, it's difficult.",sv
191470,B,"What about other, other benefits?",qo
191471,B,Are there others that you're dissatisfied with?,qo
191472,A,"Well, I work for Sears,",sd
191473,A,"and, and, um, that's about the, the only real benefit you have, is health insurance.",sd
191474,B,"Well, you have vacation, I",qy^d
191475,A,"Yeah,",ny
191476,A,"yeah,",ny
191477,A,but everybody gets vacation.,ar
191478,A,"I mean, like, uh, T I and some other places, you know, they have recreational facilities,",sd
191479,A,and they have a driving range and weight room,sd
191480,A,"and, you know, I think they even have a swimming pool",sv
191481,B,Huh.,b
191482,A,and I don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that.,sd
191483,B,"Yeah,",b
191484,B,"I'm not familiar with that sort of thing,",sd
191485,B,"but you know, to me vacation is, is an issue,",sd
191486,B,"and I mean, different places have different amounts of vacation, I would assume.",sv
191487,A,Right.,b
191488,B,"And, um, you know, the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay, perhaps or, um, I don't know, I suppose, um, sick days.",sd
191489,B,Some places count the number of hours,sv
191490,B,and some places just sort of believe you.,sv
191491,A,Uh-huh.,b
191492,B,"Um, ours is based on number of days,",sd
191493,B,"and, you know, people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill.",sd
191494,A,Right.,b
191495,B,Right.,b
191496,B,"But, um, otherwise, I'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here",sd
191497,B,So maybe that covers the topic then.,sv
191498,A,Yeah.,b
191499,A,"Well, I don't know, the the working conditions, you know, if you could include that in benefits.",sv
191500,A,Some places aren't very safe to work.,sv
191501,B,Uh-huh.,b
191502,A,"And, and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you, that you have to work under.",sv
191503,B,Uh-huh.,b
191504,B,"Or maybe a uh, not really a benefit, either, but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls.",sv
191505,A,"Right,",b
191506,A,uh-huh.,b
191507,B,"Um, but, you know I suppose some places are, are more stringent about that than others.",sv
191508,A,"Yeah,",aa
191509,A,I think so.,sv
191510,B,"And, and, maybe arriving late or something like that, you know,",sv
191511,B,"how, how they enforce the rules.",sv
191512,A,Uh-huh,b
191513,B,"But other than that I don't have much feeling for, for the benefits,",sd
191514,B,"since, like I said, um, I don't have a big problem with, with them.",sd
191515,A,"Um, workmen's comp is a big thing now in, in Texas because, um, um, how much it costs the employers",sd
191516,B,Uh-huh.,b
191517,A,"and a, a lot of them are going to their own insurance now.",sd
191518,A,"And it reduces some of the length of the benefits, and, uh, and I don't know besides that.",sd
191519,A,"But I, I noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing.",sd
191520,B,"Oh I, I didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation.",sd
191521,A,"Well, well, they still have to pay it",sd
191522,A,but they buy their own instead of going through the state.,sd
191523,B,"Oh, I see.",bk
191524,A,So apparently it costs less that way.,sd
191525,B,"Uh-huh,",b
191526,B,uh-huh.,b
191527,B,"I suppose that whenever companies can avoid, um, benefits, it's to the, to, to the benefit of the company",sv
191528,A,Uh-huh.,b
191529,B,"and at least, you know, financially in the short run,",sv
191530,B,but I would think they would get a much greater turnover,sv
191531,B,and that people would be dissatisfied,sv
191532,A,Yeah.,aa
191533,A,"That's what I, what I think",sd
191534,A,"they should be able, they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are",sv
191535,A,and how much profit they're making,sv
191536,A,instead of trying to cut everything down *listen,sv
191537,A,"and then have everybody be unhappy and, and have a constant turnover of people.",sv
191538,B,"I mean, sure, the payroll is lower that way,",sv
191539,B,"but I would assume that the productivity is way down, also.",sv
191540,A,"Yeah,",aa
191541,A,"the productivity and the training costs,",sv
191542,A,"if they have to train the same employee, a new employee every six months, then I don't see how they can save money.",sv
191543,B,"Uh-huh,",b
191544,B,uh-huh.,b
191545,A,"You know, and once they once they get somebody good, they ought to hang onto them.",sv

191689,B,"Gave you an idea of what your child, was progressing in or doing.",bf
191690,A,Yeah.,aa

191693,B,Yeah.,aa
191694,B,Yeah.,aa

191698,A,They may not say anything.,sv
191699,B,"Right,",aa
191700,B,right.,aa

191702,B,You can't really.,aa
191703,B,"You can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something,",sv

191705,B,and usually they aren't at that age. Uh-huh.,sd
191706,A,Uh-huh.,b

191904,A,Uh-huh.,b
191905,B,"That certainly was interesting,",sv
191906,B,"since all of us had, uh, ancestors that came over that way.",sd
191907,B,"Or not all,",sd

191917,B,"Oh, yeah,",aa
191918,B,those were laws are unusual.,sv
191919,A,"Yeah,",b
191920,A,and then they'll ship the parents back,sd

191923,B,"Yeah,",b

191927,B,that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all that you would do it that way.,sv
191928,A,Right.,b
191929,A,Uh-huh.,b
191930,B,"You would think they could at least get a, a, a visa or something until they, uh, get citizenship.",sv
191931,B,I'm sure they want to.,sv
191932,A,"Yeah,",b
191933,A,"and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove, when was that, it was in the eighties some time if they could prove they'd been here five years.",sd

191937,B,Yeah.,b

191947,B,What the controls are.,sd

191967,A,Yeah,b
191968,B,"Yeah,",%
191969,B,"well it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the, one of the few countries that people are still desperately trying to immigrate to.",sd
191970,B,"Uh, although I guess Europe, now that the Communism is falling apart, that maybe there'll be, won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist countries, uh,",sv

191972,B,"so maybe not,",sv
191973,A,Uh-huh.,b
191974,B,"maybe immigration from Europe to here will you know slowly, uh, change,",sv
191975,B,"maybe it'll be, even out like trade, you know.",sv
191976,B,"So many people will immigrate here in the twentieth, at the year two thousand,",sv

191981,A,I think so.,aa
191982,B,"It doesn't, has, doesn't seem so far.",sv

191984,B,Uh-huh.,b
191985,A,like orchestra players can find a job sometimes line in Europe when they can't find one here.,sd
