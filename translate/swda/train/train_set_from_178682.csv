183407,B,I believe it.,sv
183408,A,Uh-huh.,b
183409,B,That's awful.,ba
183410,B,So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it.,sv
183411,B,I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing.,sd
183412,B,"But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, you know, for people to report it.",sv

183415,A,Yeah.,b
183416,B,"I don't know,",h
183417,B,"it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs, you know.",sv

183419,B,"it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, you know,",sd
183420,B,because these kids are saying why should I go to high school,sv
183421,B,"and so I can go out and work at Burger King, you know, for four dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs.",^q
183422,B,So that's certainly a big problem.,sv
183423,B,I don't know what the solution to that is.,sv
183424,B,Having more drug treatment centers available.,sv
183425,B,"Jeez, I don't know.",h
183426,A,"Uh. See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything.",sv
183427,B,Yeah.,b
183428,A,I know a lot of people that partake in that.,sd
183429,A,"And I'm not saying they're bad people,",sd
183430,A,"but I, I, I would say that's a bigger problem.",sv
183431,B,Yeah.,b
183432,B,"Because it ends up,",%
183433,B,"even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, you know,",sv
183434,B,"huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, you know, on higher and higher up, on drugs,",sv
183435,A,Uh-huh.,b
183436,B,and it's definitely got to do with crime.,sv

183438,B,"I mean, just, oh,",%
183439,B,"gosh, horrible stuff like that.",sv

183850,B,and it goes there,sd
183851,B,and it stays there,sd

183854,A,"See, I think we might have to do that",sd
183855,A,"Of course, she looks at what she brings home each week.",sd

184736,A,"I think through our health insurance that I can get better rates as a, through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because I had to do that at one time when I wasn't employed with a large corporation",sd

185277,B,"As far as the number of drug users, you mean?",qy
185278,A,Yeah,ny
185279,B,Huh.,b
185280,A,as far as the number of people they actually found that were drug users.,sd
185281,A,"But I think that on when I was at T I of course, we had all the information before they started.",sd
185282,B,Right.,b
185283,A,And they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs.,sd
185284,A,"And I think that's what helps, you know, that in the warning that you have a drug program, the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs, actually go",sv
185285,A,and then usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything.,sv
185286,B,"Right,",b
185287,B,"yeah,",b
185288,B,so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee.,sv
185289,A,"Yeah,",b
185290,A,and our numbers have been way down.,sd
185291,A,I don't know what they were.,sd
185292,B,"When I worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person,",sd
185293,B,"and so we had,",%
185294,B,"when we sent temporaries to T I, we had to have their drug tested.",sd
185295,A,Yeah.,b
185296,B,"And we did have a couple of cases where we really, the person said that they hadn't used anything,",sd
185297,B,"and their test came back positive,",sd
185298,B,and normally we didn't retest them.,sd
185299,B,But there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth,sd
185300,B,"and we retested them like the next day,",sd
185301,B,and they came back negative the second time.,sd
185302,A,"Oh, really.",b
185303,B,"So that, that's the only thing, I think, that might be a little bit of a problem.",sv
185304,A,"Oh, you're,",%
185305,A,"that's a good point,",sv
185306,A,"but at T I they, before they had the testing, I've forgotten, seems like it's a year ago September, something like that, they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government.",sd
185307,A,"And, of course, that's critical, just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to be, you know, have a lot of quality control, that they keep track of everything.",sd
185308,A,They don't make mistakes.,sd
185309,A,That would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive,sv
185310,B,Right.,b
185311,A,and they were not.,sd
185312,A,"And I haven't heard of any,",sd
185313,A,now I'm not in personnel or anything.,sd
185314,B,Yeah.,b
185315,A,"But, uh, they say that there, it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not.",sd
185316,A,"In other words, there's very few mistakes,",sd
185317,A,"and that, of course, has got to be critical.",sd
185318,A,"It's got to be, if you have a drug testing program,",sv
185319,A,"it's got to be with a very, very good agency.",sv
185320,A,You don't just have some local group do it.,sv
185321,A,It's got to be a highly qualified agency.,sv
185322,B,"Right,",b
185323,B,"yeah,",b
185324,B,not just some doctor's office somewhere.,sd
185325,A,"No,",aa
185326,A,you don't want to do that.,sv
185327,A,It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check.,sv
185328,A,And I think that T I is latched themselves up with an established group.,sd
185329,A,"And that would be good for any company that does it, and not to have just a very casual thing.",sv
185330,A,"It's got to be with a, you know, first class, totally independent agency. Not local of course.",sv
185331,A,"Ours, I think, well I think it was in the south somewhere,",sv
185332,A,"but it wasn't even in Dallas, you know, the one that did us.",sd
185333,B,Oh really.,b
185334,A,Yeah.,aa
185335,B,"Huh. Do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive,",qy

185337,A,"Oh, no.",nn
185338,A,They're not fired.,sd
185339,A,"They are, they have one chance to then go in a program.",sd
185340,A,"You come back positive, you have one chance to go in, and go into, they have a lot of, uh, rehabilitation, both for alcohol and for drug use,",sd
185341,A,"and they have, uh, a lot of, uh, they have an agency where you can go for personal problems, financial or whatever.",sd
185342,B,Right.,b
185343,A,"And so they, they, they don't,",sd
185344,A,"no,",nn
185345,A,it's not firing first.,sd
185346,A,"It's, uh, definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate.",sd
185347,A,"In fact, again, before you go, you know, that's why I said, when they first started it, they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs, go ahead and get rehabilitated first,",sd
185348,A,and they won't say anything about it.,sd
185349,B,Right.,b
185350,B,I think that's really good.,sv

185477,A,"I mean, I may have screwed in a little screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something",sd
185478,A,"but, uh, I personally haven't done anything.",sd
185479,A,"Maybe I've, uh, changed wiper blades or something",sd
185480,A,"but I have noticed since, uh, I got married that my husband, he hates to do auto repairs,",sd
185481,A,"but he would rather do them himself than, than to pay someone else.",sd
185482,A,"I guess, he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows, he knows how to do it,",sd
185483,A,and he'll do it.,sd
185484,A,"So, he, he hates the time that he takes,",sd
185485,A,"but he has changed, um, the brakes",sd
185486,A,and he has done all of the tune-ups,sd
185487,A,and the like that,sd
185488,A,and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car.,sd
185489,A,I was really impressed with that,sd
185490,A,"We had to have it to get the car inspected,",sd
185491,A,it wouldn't pass inspection,sd
185492,A,"and, and so, he priced around",sd
185493,A,and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it,sd
185494,A,"so, he thought, well, I can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars, which he did",sd
185495,A,"and then, he did it",sd
185496,A,"and, so, I guess, uh, he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up,",sd
185497,A,"what, uh, what's your experience been like?",qo
185498,B,"Well, I, uh, I have a long experience with cars.",sd
185499,B,"I, uh, when I was younger, uh, my brother had a Corvette",sd
185500,B,and I bought a Corvette,sd
185501,B,and when you have a Corvette you more or less do all the work,sd
185502,B,"and I've done everything from build the motor from the, uh, you know, the bare block on up.",sd
185503,B,"And, I, I'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car, I hate to go pay somebody good money, you know,",sd
185504,B,I hate to pay somebody twenty-five dollars on hour for something I can do myself.,sd
185505,A,Uh-huh.,b
185506,B,"It just, to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that.",sv
185507,A,Right.,b
185508,B,"In fact, I, um, just this past weekend put new plugs in both, uh, my car an my wife's car.",sd
185509,A,Uh-huh.,b
185510,B,"And so, I, uh, I pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything I can do myself",sd
185511,B,"but I've, I've gotten to the point in my life, um, you know, I just crept over forty years old, where I don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore",sd
185512,A,That makes sense.,ba
185513,B,"I mean it's, um, I don't know whether I've, I've just reached a point, you know,",sd
185514,B,"it's, it's real rough in the winter time.",sd
185515,A,"Huh, yes.",b
185516,B,"And, uh, so, I try to make sure that, uh, by the time fall runs around, because we actually have winters here on the east coast, um, that, uh, I have, you know, the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter",sd
185517,A,Right,b
185518,B,"and, uh, then springtime I usually end up giving them, the, uh, a tune-up and make sure that they're running well,",sd
185519,B,"and, uh, you know, it's like I had the muffler go out on my, on my car, shortly before it was required to go,",sd
185520,B,"in Maryland they have, uh, emission tests.",sd
185521,A,Uh-huh.,b
185522,B,"And you're required to get your car and go through the emission test,",sd
185523,B,"well, my muffler, of course, starting going bad right before I was supposed to go to the emission test,",sd
185524,B,"so. You know, I had to do that job,",sd
185525,B,"and of course, that was back in December when it's nice and cold outside",sd
185526,A,"Yes,",b
185527,A,I'm sure it was.,ba
185528,B,"But the thing was that I could do the job myself,",sd
185529,B,"I mean, the parts cost me, oh, roughly a hundred dollars.",sd
185530,A,Uh-huh.,b
185531,B,"Um, if I'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty-five.",sd
185532,A,Right.,b
185533,B,Now like who's got that extra two and a quarter,qh
185534,B,I know I don't.,sd
185535,A,Yeah.,b
185536,A,"Well, that's exactly the way he feels is that, he really hates to spend the time,",sd
185537,A,it takes a lot of time,sd
185538,A,"if he, if he thinks it's going to be two hours, it's four if, you know, whatever, it always takes him twice as long.",sd
185539,A,"But then when he's finished he's, he always says, well, now you owe me three hundred dollars",sd
185540,A,"And then he thinks that he has the money that, that he can spend on something",sd
185541,A,and he hasn't given it to someone else.,sd
185542,B,Yeah.,b
185543,A,"So, he gets some satisfaction out of that although, generally I think he, he does not look forward to or anticipate,",sd
185544,A,there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars.,sd
185545,A,There's a lot of people,sd
185546,A,and he just isn't one of them.,sd
185547,B,Yeah.,b
185548,B,"I, uh, I don't mind it,",sd
185549,B,"um, there was a time when I had my Corvette,",sd
185550,B,"I mean, of course, I loved it, um,",sd
185551,B,"but if, you know,",%
185552,B,I've got other interests now,sd
185553,B,"and there's a lot, other more important things I think I should be doing with my time.",sd
185554,B,"And I have the same problem,",sd
185555,B,"I mean, you can tell him from me",ad
185556,B,"but it doesn't matter,",sd
185557,B,"I mean, I've, I've had greasy fingernails for years",sd
185558,B,"And it still takes me twice as long as I think it's going to take to do the job,",sd
185559,A,Yeah.,b
185560,B,"so, but, I think the difference is that, uh, when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing,",sd
185561,A,Uh-huh.,b
185562,B,"and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right,",sd
185563,B,"and, you know, I've, I've in the past I've had brake jobs done by someone that when I went back and looked at it some months later I'd find something drastically wrong with it, you know, like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident. You know, those kind of things,",sd
185564,A,Right.,b
185565,A,Right.,b
185566,B,"and when you have a vehicle that's being used by, you know, other members of your family, you know, you don't want that kind of a situation to come up.",sd
185567,A,No.,b
185568,B,"And it's very, very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust.",sv
185569,B,I only have one guy that I know that I trust to work on my car.,sd
185570,A,Uh-huh.,b
185571,B,"And, uh, he's about sixty miles from here.",sd
185572,B,"And so, it,",%
185573,B,"and if I have something that's really major that I can't handle or feel I don't have the time to handle, I'll take it to him to do it.",sd
185574,A,"Right,",b
185575,A,"you know, that it's, uh , really has a bad reputation is to feel that, that people in general feel and have, have rightly so, I think been cheated many times,",sd
185576,A,"and, um, and well, I know once when we had a,",sd
185577,A,we usually inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car,sd
185578,A,"but, um, once the muffler needed to be changed",sd
185579,A,"and, uh, he had looked at him himself",sd
185580,A,"and, but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change",sd
185581,A,"he said, that's really, really good",sd
185582,A,"so, he went in",sd
185583,A,"and, uh, but when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something.",sd
185584,A,"Anyway, but the car that the muffler people had, um, my, at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further, you know,",sd
185585,A,"they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever,",sd
185586,B,Uh-huh.,b
185587,A,"and so, since then, I don't think he's ever even seriously considered a, you know, any kind of job he thought he could do himself.",sd
185588,A,"But, I know from his childhood, he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment, I guess.",sd
185589,A,"And, um, so, Kelly growing up, he, he felt like that, that was a good way on Saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father.",sd
185590,B,Uh-huh.,b
185591,A,"And so, he used, they used car repairs kind of as a way to have a, you know, something that they did together,",sd
185592,B,Uh-huh.,b
185593,B,Yeah.,b
185594,A,"and he thought that turned out pretty good because it, you know, it helped him to understand and be functional now,",sd
185595,A,"and it helped him to have a close relationship,",sd
185596,A,"so, that's one, one way he looked at it.",sd
185597,B,Yeah.,b
185598,B,"that's probably, uh, uh, something that, uh, is, is you know, is good for both of them.",sd
185599,B,"I know that, uh, my older son I could never get him interested in cars",sd
185600,B,"and I couldn't, you know,",sd
185601,B,"I just like, you know,",sd
185602,B,"you sure you're a boy,",^q
185603,B,"I mean, your not interested in cars,",^q
185604,A,Uh-huh.,b
185605,B,"I mean he, he just would not have anything to do with them.",sd
185606,B,"And, uh, later on and like when he, you know, grew up, got out of the house, got his own car, um, he didn't know how to do anything to it. I mean, absolutely nothing.",sd
185607,B,"I mean, he couldn't even check the oil.",sd
185608,B,"I mean, that's, that's how uninformed he was and disinterested.",sd
185609,A,Uh-huh.,b
185610,B,"And, I guess there are some people out there like that, um, you know,",sd
185611,B,"I always thought maybe, you know, if he took more of an interest and, you know, what I was doing",sd
185612,B,and maybe we could have communicated better.,sd
185613,A,Uh-huh.,b
185614,B,"But, uh, yeah,",b

185616,A,"Yeah,",b
185617,A,it didn't always work.,sd
185618,A,"Well, I felt, um, I feel like I could myself, do some things but, that I have enough responsibility that if I have someone like my father when I was living at home, and my husband, that's willing to do it, I go ahead and let them do it.",sd
185619,A,"I don't feel the need to, um, you know, be a feminist on that issue and say I can take care of my own things.",sd
185620,A,"I'm, I'm happy to let them run the cars because I have so, many other responsibilities that, um,",sd

185622,B,"Uh, I trained my, uh, my wife in the in, in doing things,",sd
185623,B,"in fact, uh, when I, uh, first transferred down to, uh, Texas Instruments back in nineteen eighty-seven, um, uh, when I left here, uh, she had to change a set of plugs on the car because she was up here for a month or so, after I was",sd

185629,A,"It's a good experience,",ba

187135,A,Uh-huh.,b
187136,B,"So, that grows pretty good",sd

187192,B,So you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that.,sd
187193,A,"Yeah,",b

187238,B,"Yeah,",b
187239,B,"we're doing an H M O right now, um,",sd
187240,B,"and when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars,",sd
187241,B,"but,  you know, sometime, sometimes when you go, you know, the prescription,",sd

187245,B,that's like a buck a capsule.,sd
187246,A,Uh-huh.,b
187247,B,So if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty-four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings.,sd
187248,B,"Then there's other times that, you know, maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than like seven or eight dollars",sd
187249,B,and you pay five anyhow.,sd

191452,A,"it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then, uh, you just pay ten dollars",sd

191454,A,"Or if you go outside you get, uh, seventy thirty.",sd
191455,B,"Now we,",%
191456,B,I have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered,sd
191457,B,"but what I found recently is what they've been doing is they, they poll somehow the area,",sd
191458,B,and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code.,sd
191459,A,Uh-huh.,b
191460,B,"And so recently, when, when we had a claim, um, they didn't pay the eighty-five percent they paid much lower",sd
191461,B,"and when I called they said, Oh well, that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area.",sd
191462,B,"And I was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code, so that, you know, two doctors could balance each other out, or their, you know, their statistics aren't very accurate. *listen",sd

191480,A,"and, you know, I think they even have a swimming pool",sv

191483,B,"Yeah,",b
191484,B,"I'm not familiar with that sort of thing,",sd
191485,B,"but you know, to me vacation is, is an issue,",sd
191486,B,"and I mean, different places have different amounts of vacation, I would assume.",sv
191487,A,Right.,b
191488,B,"And, um, you know, the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay, perhaps or, um, I don't know, I suppose, um, sick days.",sd
191489,B,Some places count the number of hours,sv
191490,B,and some places just sort of believe you.,sv
191491,A,Uh-huh.,b
191492,B,"Um, ours is based on number of days,",sd

191494,A,Right.,b
191495,B,Right.,b
191496,B,"But, um, otherwise, I'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here",sd
191497,B,So maybe that covers the topic then.,sv
191498,A,Yeah.,b
191499,A,"Well, I don't know, the the working conditions, you know, if you could include that in benefits.",sv
191500,A,Some places aren't very safe to work.,sv
191501,B,Uh-huh.,b
191502,A,"And, and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you, that you have to work under.",sv
191503,B,Uh-huh.,b
191504,B,"Or maybe a uh, not really a benefit, either, but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls.",sv
191505,A,"Right,",b
191506,A,uh-huh.,b
191507,B,"Um, but, you know I suppose some places are, are more stringent about that than others.",sv
191508,A,"Yeah,",aa
191509,A,I think so.,sv
191510,B,"And, and, maybe arriving late or something like that, you know,",sv
191511,B,"how, how they enforce the rules.",sv
191512,A,Uh-huh,b
191513,B,"But other than that I don't have much feeling for, for the benefits,",sd
191514,B,"since, like I said, um, I don't have a big problem with, with them.",sd
191515,A,"Um, workmen's comp is a big thing now in, in Texas because, um, um, how much it costs the employers",sd
191516,B,Uh-huh.,b
191517,A,"and a, a lot of them are going to their own insurance now.",sd
191518,A,"And it reduces some of the length of the benefits, and, uh, and I don't know besides that.",sd
191519,A,"But I, I noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing.",sd
191520,B,"Oh I, I didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation.",sd
191521,A,"Well, well, they still have to pay it",sd
191522,A,but they buy their own instead of going through the state.,sd
191523,B,"Oh, I see.",bk
191524,A,So apparently it costs less that way.,sd
191525,B,"Uh-huh,",b
191526,B,uh-huh.,b
191527,B,"I suppose that whenever companies can avoid, um, benefits, it's to the, to, to the benefit of the company",sv
191528,A,Uh-huh.,b
191529,B,"and at least, you know, financially in the short run,",sv

191532,A,Yeah.,aa
191533,A,"That's what I, what I think",sd
191534,A,"they should be able, they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are",sv

191536,A,instead of trying to cut everything down *listen,sv

191811,B,Yeah.,b
191812,A,So he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us.,sv

191873,A,yeah,%
191874,A,"I took Spanish in school,",sd

191887,A,"well, it's basically on the, well,",sd
191888,A,"I think it's mostly concentrated toward the borders,",sv
191889,A,"and, uh, it's more, um,",%
191890,A,"the immigration is tied in with, uh, drug trafficking.",sd
191891,A,"So they have to watch out who comes in,",sd

191904,A,Uh-huh.,b
191905,B,"That certainly was interesting,",sv
191906,B,"since all of us had, uh, ancestors that came over that way.",sd
191907,B,"Or not all,",sd
191908,B,"but I guess, I guess if you go back far enough you came over on a boat originally, you know.",sv

191914,B,"So we all immigrants, one way or another, well",sv
191915,B,"we certainly are, coming from Europe.",sd
191916,A,"and one of the, one of the things that really gets to me, uh, about the Mexicans is that, um, once they have children over here, their children are American citizens then.",sd
191917,B,"Oh, yeah,",aa
191918,B,those were laws are unusual.,sv
191919,A,"Yeah,",b
191920,A,and then they'll ship the parents back,sd
191921,A,and that leaves the children without any parents.,sd
191922,A,"So, And they, you know, and, and they just follow the rule no matter, you know.",sd
191923,B,"Yeah,",b
191924,A,So that doesn't seem fair to the children.,sv
191925,B,"sometimes common sense should take over rather than,",sv
191926,B,"yeah,",%
191927,B,that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all that you would do it that way.,sv
191928,A,Right.,b
191929,A,Uh-huh.,b
191930,B,"You would think they could at least get a, a, a visa or something until they, uh, get citizenship.",sv
191931,B,I'm sure they want to.,sv
191932,A,"Yeah,",b
191933,A,"and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove, when was that, it was in the eighties some time if they could prove they'd been here five years.",sd
191934,B,"Oh, yeah.",b
191935,B,"I heard something about that, yeah.",sd
191936,A,"And, uh, a lot of them had been, you know.",sd
191937,B,Yeah.,b
191938,A,"Some of them, some of them moved back and forth,",sd

191945,A,Uh-huh.,b
191946,B,I don't know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything.,sd
191947,B,What the controls are.,sd

191949,B,Yeah.,b

191966,B,"Oh, well yeah.",b
191967,A,Yeah,b
191968,B,"Yeah,",%
191969,B,"well it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the, one of the few countries that people are still desperately trying to immigrate to.",sd
191970,B,"Uh, although I guess Europe, now that the Communism is falling apart, that maybe there'll be, won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist countries, uh,",sv

191972,B,"so maybe not,",sv
191973,A,Uh-huh.,b
191974,B,"maybe immigration from Europe to here will you know slowly, uh, change,",sv
191975,B,"maybe it'll be, even out like trade, you know.",sv
191976,B,"So many people will immigrate here in the twentieth, at the year two thousand,",sv

191979,B,I don't know.,h

191981,A,I think so.,aa
191982,B,"It doesn't, has, doesn't seem so far.",sv

191984,B,Uh-huh.,b
191985,A,like orchestra players can find a job sometimes line in Europe when they can't find one here.,sd

191997,B,Yeah.,b

192006,A,It's like any other symphony.,sd
192007,B,Yeah,b

192034,A,Sure.,ba
192035,B,"we would like the, uh, industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration, because we feel that, uh, the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much. Huh-uh.",sd
