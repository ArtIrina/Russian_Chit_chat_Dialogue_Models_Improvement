1,A,"I've, uh,",%
2,A,"as far as I'm concerned, I find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating,",sv
3,A,and I think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now.,sv
4,B,Uh-huh.,aa
5,B,"Oh, well, I tend, I tend to agree.",aa
6,B,"Uh, in some ways I think it's, uh, I think if anything, a lot of, um, the changes that have occurred, uh,",sv
7,B,in some ways they're for the better,sv
8,B,"because I think women should have a choice,",sv
9,B,"and I do believe in the, being able to have a choice as to, as far as, what you would like to do with your life.",sv
10,B,"But by the same token, and I know this for myself because I've worked and I've not worked, um,",sd
11,B,"that it makes it, uh, sometimes it makes life more difficult.",sv
12,B,"I think when the roles now are less defined, as far as, you know, what, uh, women should or should not be doing, that it, it, it could make life more difficult.",sv
13,B,There are more things to work out.,sv
14,B,"I know when I was working, you know, you have all these problems with, with the child care and, and with, uh, pleasing, you know, your boss on the job,",sv
15,B,so you have added stresses from there,sv
16,B,"and then you still have all the things that, um, that you need to do at home",sv
17,B,"and that doesn't change, you know,",sv
18,B,"just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't, uh, make those other things go away",sv
19,B,and the other responsibilities are still important.,sv
20,B,"Um,",%
21,B,"so, um, have you, have you worked outside, also and, um, feel that, it, that,",qy
22,B,"well, how do you feel, as far as, uh,",qo
23,B,what would be a happy medium,qw
24,B,"or, or what would you like to see?",qo
25,A,"I would like, uh,",sv
26,A,"yes,",ny
27,A,I have worked outside of the home,sd
28,A,"and, I was in one of those safe occupations.",sd
29,B,Yes.,b
30,A,"I was a school teacher,",sd
31,B,Uh-huh.,b
32,A,and we had one child when I taught for my two year career.,sd
33,B,Uh-huh,b
34,A,"Uh, we,",%
35,A,"uh, then I stopped teaching after my husband's business was established,",sd
36,A,and we had two children,sd
37,A,"and I stayed home with those children, and raised those children",sd
38,B,Yes.,b
39,A,"and now that my husband has retired, I am back substitute teaching,",sd
40,B,Yes.,b
41,A,"which if anyone has ever been involved in that, some days it's fun",sv
42,A,"and some days you wonder why you're even bothering,",sv
43,B,Right,b
44,A,because your fighting for your life.,sv
45,B,"But,",%
46,B,yeah.,b
47,A,"But, I am a fighter",sd
48,A,and I've always been a disciplinarian.,sd
49,A,"Uh, I'm, I'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply.",sv
50,A,I think they're going in by choice.,sv
51,B,"Oh, I think so.",aa
52,B,Yes.,aa
53,A,Yes.,b^m
54,A,"And, and I have no problem with that,",sv
55,A,but I think the male needs to be the dominant person.,sv
56,A,"And I think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand, uh, are not letting that happen.",sv
57,B,Uh-huh.,b
58,A,They are very aggressive.,sv
59,B,Uh-huh.,b
60,A,"They're, uh, they almost have what I would call a killer killer bee instinct.",sv
61,B,Yeah.,b
62,A,And they have to be in charge.,sv
63,A,"And, and I I think they lose a lot by what I call neutering their husbands.",sv
64,B,Uh-huh.,b
65,B,"Children Well, what do you think, ater running",qw
66,B,"though, um, um,",%
67,B,I don't know.,h
68,B,"I,",%
69,B,"the, the one problem I guess I have,",sv
70,B,"and maybe what so many women, younger women now are choosing to go outside is,",sv
71,B,"I feel that in general, in this society, that being at home is not looked upon as, um, a job in itself.",sv
72,B,"Whereas, you know, you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself,",sd
73,B,"but I know when I was working,",sd
74,B,"and I was an engineer so I was always with men,",sd
75,B,"uh, and they were single, many of them,",sd
76,B,"and I tried to explain to them, well, my day doesn't end when I leave at,",sd
77,B,"I used to leave at three, I keep going to eleven at night",sd
78,A,Uh-huh.,b
79,B,"and they had, they used to look down on women that were home,",sd
80,B,"they'd say, oh, I bet you go home and,",sd
81,B,"you know, at least you get out of here at three",^q
82,B,"and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas,",^q
83,A,"Oh, sure <laughter>.",b
84,B,"and I used to be infuriated,",sd
85,A,Uh-huh.,b
86,B,because they really had no idea what was involved once I got home.,sd
87,B,"Now taking care of them, running them everywhere, helping with homework, the bath, the whole, you know, everything.",sd
88,B,"Um, and I think that one reason that so many younger women feel compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected, and that being home is not a respectable, uh, position in society.",sv
89,A,Huh.,b
90,B,"And, there's a lot of truth to that",sv
91,B,and I don't know how you feel.,sd
92,B,"I don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got,",sd
93,B,but I can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home.,sv
94,B,"And yet by the same token, I think some of it is jealousy,",sv
95,B,"you, you,",%
96,B,"once in a while, you hear them say things like, I wish I had the choice, you know.",sd
97,A,Uh-huh.,b
98,B,"I wish I was the one,",^q
99,B,"I would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us,",^q
100,A,"If my wife had an education and could support us,",^2
101,A,"and the only value I see coming out of, this is that children now in, in a two parent home, they now actually have two parents,",sv
102,B,<Children> Uh-huh.,b
103,B,Yeah.,b
104,A,"because I see my sons-in-law,",sd
105,A,I have a daughter who's a nurse,sd
106,A,"and I have a daughter, who's a beautician.",sd
107,B,Right.,b
108,A,"And I see, my sons-in-law cooking and, dropping children off at the sitter and, picking children up from school and, and having a much better relationship with their children, than my husband ever did",sd
109,B,Uh-huh.,b
110,B,Right.,b
111,B,Right.,b
112,B,Right <noise>.,b
113,B,Uh-huh.,b
114,B,That's true.,sv
115,A,"because he, left home at five thirty in the morning,",sd
116,B,That's true.,sv
117,A,and he got home at six fifteen.,sd
118,B,Yes.,b
119,A,"And, uh, he ate his dinner",sd
120,A,and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted.,sd
121,B,Right.,b
122,A,"So, now the young fathers are having a chance to parent,",sv
123,A,"and I think, that's an advantage.",sv
124,B,And they enjoy it.,^2
125,B,Yeah.,aa
126,B,And they do enjoy it.,sv
127,B,"I, I see,",sd
128,A,Uh-huh.,b
129,B,you're right.,aa
130,B,"I see many more men in the supermarket, in the parks with their children,",sd
131,A,"Uh-huh,",b
132,A,uh-huh.,b
133,B,and I think that is healthy because,sv
134,A,"And I think it's a, a wonderful advantage for the young, for the, for the, particularly for the males, for the little boys to have, a relationship with their father,",sv
135,B,Right.,aa
136,B,"Oh, yeah.",aa
137,A,"and, and I don't, think you, we get into so much of the mother dominating figure, if, if the father has more input there.",sv
138,B,Yes.,aa
139,B,Yeah.,b
140,A,"But, uh, I don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads,",sv
141,A,"and they have to, that kind of job, uh, to go out there and shovel that tar and, and drive those big trucks.",sd
142,A,"And we just recently finished a long drive through the west, a little over five thousand miles,",sd
143,B,Uh-huh.,b
144,A,"and at one point we sat down, uh,",sd
145,A,"I didn't realize it,",sd
146,A,but I sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only.,sd
147,B,Uh-huh.,b
148,A,And here's this young girl with the tattoos,sd
149,A,"and she has just, had just driven a load of meat from Minneapolis to some place in Arizona,",sd
150,B,Uh-huh.,b
151,A,"and she'd been,",sd
152,A,and I ask her how old she was,sd
153,A,and she was the between the age of our daughters,sd
154,A,"and she had been driving, a truck for seven years.",sd
155,B,Uh-huh.,b
156,A,"And I thought, gosh,",sd
157,A,"I mean, why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life-style when,",sv
158,B,Yeah.,b
159,A,I guess I'm I'm maybe Victorian,sv
160,A,"and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist,",sv
161,A,"in that, he's a very considerate person,",sv
162,A,"but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and, and in the home,",sd
163,A,"and she should vote,",sd
164,A,but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote.,sd
165,B,"Oh, boy <laughter>.",ba
166,A,"Now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because I have strong opinions about things, too,",sd
167,B,Yeah.,b
168,A,"but, uh, I like being taken care of.",sd
169,A,"I like my luggage, carried and, my door opened,",sd
170,B,"Well,",h
171,A,and I think the young women are losing that,sv
172,A,and I think that's sad.,sv
173,B,"well, that, that's true.",aa
174,B,"There is that part, too,",sv
175,B,and I guess we also have to examine though,sv
176,B,"and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as, you know, anybody else,",sv
177,A,"He was raised in the south,",sd
178,B,"um,",b
179,A,"I think that's a little condition,",sv
180,B,"I guess ha-,",%
181,A,both.,%
182,B,"Oh, oh, yeah.",b
183,B,"And, and you have to, I guess you have to question too, why a lot of the men, especially, I think middle age and older men, why they feel that way",sv
184,B,"and, and I think it gets scary for them to see change, also.",sv
185,B,"They've been used to being, really to be honest, in, in society, and in a way, number one,",sv
186,B,and they come home,sd
187,B,and everything's done for them.,sd
188,A,Uh-huh.,b
189,A,Huh.,b
190,B,And their meal is served,sd
191,B,and I think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching.,sv
192,A,Sure.,aa
193,B,"And I think, I think this reaction comes more out of fear.",sv
194,B,"Now, my husband is, um, he's ten years older than me,",sd
195,B,"and,",%
196,B,"but he has, his attitudes are very much pro-women, pro-career, which is kind of interesting.",sv
197,A,Uh-huh.,b
198,B,"He comes from a culture where women are, stay at home and do everything,",sd
199,A,Uh-huh.,b
200,B,"um, and yet, um, he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility, um, if that meant, oor you know, for me to be able to, uh, uh, advance or go back to work or whatever.",sd
201,B,"I'm kind of more,",sd
202,B,"alking to someone in background, thank you, esumes talking to speaker A",t3
203,B,I'm kind of more middle of the road.,sd
204,B,"I think that when children are small, I think it's okay for women to work especially,",sv
205,B,"there should be some, a lot more part time,",sv
206,B,"but I think it's, um,",sv
207,B,"I don't believe in this career, you know, this career drive when, when they're small, because I think,",sv
208,A,Uh-huh.,b
209,B,"alking to someone in background, they're downstairs esumes talking to A",t3
210,B,"I think that's very, um, unfair to, to children,",sv
211,B,"like, uh, engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week,",sd
212,A,Uh-huh.,b
213,A,Huh.,b
214,A,Huh.,b
215,B,I refused to work more than thirty.,sd
216,A,Uh-huh.,b
217,B,I was part-time,sd
218,B,"and even that was a rat race,",sv
219,A,Huh.,b
220,B,"but I think you have to put in perspective, that, you know, when the kids came home from school, I wanted to be here.",sv
221,B,"I didn't want, I don't want a job where I'm traveling around and I'm away and, uh,",sd
222,B,so I think you can have both.,sv
223,B,"It's more hectic,",sv
224,B,"but I think you have to put into perspective what your kids need, first then",sv
225,A,"I think a lot of, my problem with the young mothers ...",sv
226,B,Talk about the activities that we don't do,"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc"
227,A,Yeah.,b
228,A,"I, I don't have any children,",sd
229,A,"so,",%

235,B,"an, I haven't, uh,",%
236,B,well I've been around a lot of people lately at at my job that don't have a lot of values,sv
237,B,"So, it's, it's always nice to see people that like each other,",sv
238,B,and like families that get along with each other and like to do things together.,sv
239,A,"Yeah,",b
240,A,"have a lot of values,",bf

247,A,"Oh, that's wonderful",ba
248,B,"But, it, it's kind of weighed on me",sd
249,B,"and then the other day my husband and I met a couple who, who,",sd
250,B,they're just going to have their first child,sd
251,B,and they really like each other.,sd
252,B,And they're real happy with one another,sd

268,A,and they're gone a lot,sd
269,A,and they take their girls,sd

1217,A,Uh-huh.,b
1218,B,And I called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning,sd
1219,B,"and just driving fifty miles out of town, it was a difference,",sd
1220,B,"and, I mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars,",sd
1221,B,"but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty-five hundred,",sd
1222,A,Goodness.,ba
1223,B,is all we paid for cars in those days.,sd
1224,B,"And, uh, uh, so I called back the guy in Dallas",sd
1225,B,"and I told him that,",sd
1226,B,"I'd left him a check for tax, title and license and everything,",sd
1227,B,"and I said I want to cancel my order and, and don't try to cash the check because I'm going to, I've stopped payment on it already",sd
1228,B,"and he says oh, somebody's taking,",sd
1229,B,"he said what did you get a deal for, Bill.",sd
1230,B,"And I told him,",sd
1231,B,"he says, somebody's taking you for a ride.",sd
1232,B,"And I said, no somebody took me for a ride last Saturday",sd
1233,A,That's right.,aa
1234,B,"And, uh, uh, and I, I find that, uh,",%
1235,B,and for the longest time then I drove up to Will's Point,sd
1236,B,"and, and the, and the fellow died since then,",sd
1237,B,"and, and some of his relatives have taken over the business",sd
1238,B,"and that,",%
1239,B,but,%
1240,B,"and, since then I had ...",sd
1241,A,"Uh, our children are both, uh, basically adults.",sd
1242,A,"They, we've, we've got two.",sd
1243,A,"Uh, one is twenty-one,",sd
1244,A,and one is twenty-five.,sd
1245,B,Uh-huh.,b
1246,A,"And they, they still live at home.",sd
1247,B,Uh-huh.,b
1248,A,"Well, that's, that's a little unusual for, uh, for children of that age, to have both of them that age at home.",sv
1249,A,"But, uh, I guess the activities that, uh, we have with them are, uh, pretty few and far between.",sv
1250,A,"Actually the, they're both going on their own most of the time.",sd
1251,B,Uh-huh.,b
1252,A,"So, uh, most of our activities are, you know, just discussion type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and that kind of thing.",sd
1253,B,Uh-huh,b
1254,B,"Well, we have a, uh, three year old and a one year old.",sd
1255,B,"And, uh, so you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know.",sd
1256,A,Sure it does.,aa
1257,B,"And, uh, most of the time with a three year old we're trying to, to get him, uh,",sd
1258,B,"well, we play usually in the evening when, when I get home, you know, about five o'clock or so until about eight, you know, with the exception of dinner.",sd
1259,B,"Out in the front or backyard playing like, uh, tee ball off the, you know, off the ball and let him hit a lot of baseball.",sd
1260,B,"Uh, since we just got here we got the, uh, uh, new two wheel bike with training wheels on it for him,",sd
1261,B,and he really likes riding that around.,sd
1262,A,Uh-huh.,b
1263,A,"Oh, yeah.",b
1264,A,"I,",%
1265,B,"So, you know,",%
1266,B,"and trying to supervisor him with that and everything and, uh, playing squirt guns and all that,",sd
1267,B,he really likes that.,sd
1268,A,Yeah.,b
1269,B,"And, uh, the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything,",sd
1270,B,trying to do everything he does.,sd
1271,A,"Yeah,",b
1272,A,is the one year old a boy?,qy
1273,B,"No,",nn
1274,B,it's a girl.,sd
1275,A,A girl?,b^m
1276,B,Yeah.,ny
1277,A,"ours, uh, the older one is a girl,",sd
1278,A,so.,%
1279,A,"And the, and the younger one is a boy,",sd
1280,A,so.,%
1281,B,Yeah.,b
1282,A,"Uh, I guess, uh, what I see is so far as, uh, the trends, uh, uh, for children, uh,",sv
1283,A,"I don't know what kind of a area Virginia Beach is,",sd
1284,A,"but, of course, uh, Richardson is in the Dallas area.",sd
1285,B,Uh-huh.,b
1286,A,"And I think, uh, the big city, uh,",sv
1287,A,"activities for, for children now are,",sd
1288,A,they're good,sv
1289,A,"but there's so much, uh, potential danger, you know,",sv
1290,A,that you really have to watch your children so closely now,sv
1291,A,"that, you can't let them grow up the way, the way I grew up, you know.",sv
1292,B,Uh-huh.,b
1293,A,"I, I'm from a smaller town in east Texas.",sd
1294,A,"And I could, you know, go and do whatever, pretty much whatever I wanted to do, uh, my whole life.",sd
1295,B,Uh-huh.,b
1296,A,"Uh, you know, I never, never had to worry about the bad guys being out there.",sd
1297,B,Uh-huh.,b
1298,A,"And, uh, you know, I find it's, it's quite a bit different now",sv
1299,A,"that, uh, you know, you have to watch your children so closely and, uh, keep up with them.",sv
1300,A,"I, I feel like, uh,",sv
1301,A,"that it's, it's really a sad commentary on, uh, you know, a life in general,",sv
1302,B,Uh-huh.,b
1303,A,"that, uh, you know that children can't, cannot be allowed to grow up, uh, you know, without really close supervision.",sv
1304,B,"Well, I, I agree with that,",aa
1305,B,"and I seem, I seem to feel the same way, you know,",sv
1306,B,even just when I grew up and everything.,sd
1307,B,"And, and, the way it is now you get a lot of supervision is, is at hand and everything.",sv
1308,A,Uh-huh.,b
1309,B,"Uh, the only other thing I have noticed though is that, uh, it seems that there's been a lot of or more emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with",sv
1310,B,"and, and the looking, you know,",%
1311,B,"just start not even,",sd
1312,B,"not really looking for a school for him but, uh, like a preschool or something that where he would go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something.",sd
1313,A,Uh-huh.,b
1314,B,"For, for a three year old it's that, uh,",sd
1315,B,"there's a lot of emphasis on, on, on, on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten.",sv
1316,A,Right.,b
1317,B,"And, and it seems like it's a lot more than they need to know and be able to do than when we are the, when I had to go in kindergarten.",sv
1318,A,Yeah.,b
1319,B,"And it seems like it's more, uh,",sv
1320,B,"you know, I don't know.",h
1321,B,"They're expecting more or, uh, or just, uh, you know,",sv
1322,B,"kids just because of the computer age or whatever, it just, know more when they get, you know, to be five or six or something.",sv
1323,A,Yeah.,b
1324,B,"But,",%
1325,A,"Um, I guess looking at, uh, back at, at what our children did compared to what, uh, you know, what I had to go through in school.",sd
1326,A,"The, uh, there there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum.",sv
1327,A,It's a lot more complicated.,sv
1328,A,"A lot more available, of course.",sv
1329,B,Uh-huh.,b
1330,A,"But, uh, this,",%
1331,A,"so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult, I would think.",sv
1332,A,"I, I would probably have a hard time getting through school myself.",sv
1333,B,Uh-huh.,b
1334,A,"Uh, you know, just,",%
1335,A,or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when I went to school.,sv
1336,B,Uh-huh.,b
1337,B,One thing is I got a home computer too,sd
1338,B,"and, uh, I play, uh, with the three year old",sd
1339,B,I play some computer games and stuff with him.,sd
1340,A,Uh-huh.,b
1341,B,"Educational games like, you know, concentration type games, the matching, things like that.",sd
1342,A,Right.,b
1343,A,Yeah.,b
1344,B,"And, uh, he's, he really likes it",sd
1345,B,"and, uh, and I think it's important because I think that, uh, you know, it gives him the interaction with the computer",sv
1346,B,"because it sure looks like that's going to be you know, the big thing for a long time.",sv
1347,A,"Huh,",b
1348,B,"And given, given that knowledge and stuff with it",sd
1349,A,"yeah,",b
1350,A,"I think, uh,",%
1351,B,and he seems to enjoy it.,sv
1352,A,ery faint Oh.,b
1353,B,"And, uh, of course, the one year old hasn't, hasn't gotten there yet",sd
1354,B,"but, uh,",%
1355,B,"and the other thing we try to do is, uh, since the here is, uh, sign him up for, and her, for, uh, different activities at like the rec center or something like swimming,",sd
1356,A,Right.,b
1357,B,"you know, uh,",%
1358,B,"or,",%
1359,B,there's a little soccer thing that he's going to do for a week or so,sd
1360,B,"and, uh, you know,",%
1361,B,where they go for an hour or so.,sd
1362,A,Yeah.,b
1363,B,"And, uh,",%
1364,B,"because, uh, when he was a baby that we did the swimming too",sd
1365,B,and he really liked it,sd
1366,B,so we're going to do that with our daughter too.,sd
1367,A,Yeah.,b
1368,A,"That, uh, uh, watching a little, little boys play soccer is, is more fun.",sv
1369,A,"I can't imagine them having as much fun as the parents, had watching them",sv
1370,B,I know.,aa
1371,B,"Well, we were just talking about that too.",sd
1372,B,"And I guess it's not really soccer it's just kind of a, well, kick the ball around for a while, see what happens",sv
1373,A,"Right,",b
1374,A,yeah,b
1375,A,"The, the disorganized play really what it was,",bf
1376,A,"but, but, uh,",%
1377,B,Yeah.,aa
1378,A,"yeah,",b
1379,A,"when ours was a,",sd
1380,A,"he,",%
1381,A,"I guess he was probably five or six, you know, when he first started playing soccer.",sd
1382,B,Uh-huh.,b
1383,A,"And, uh, and that was, that was more fun to watch those boys trying to, trying to kick the ball up and down the field.",sv
1384,B,Uh-huh.,b
1385,A,"But, uh,",%
1386,A,"and it's,",%
1387,A,"I guess, that was, you know, as important, uh, as much important to the parents as it was to the children that, uh, you know, to get out and watch the kids play,",sv
1388,A,so.,%
1389,B,Uh-huh.,b
1390,A,"I guess one of the things that I think about is a, talking about education, uh, I kind of feel like, uh, that, uh, the, the school systems in this, particularly in this area, the systems are not under enough control.",sv
1391,A,"The, the students have a little too much, uh, too much leeway.",sv
1392,B,Uh-huh.,b
1393,A,Excuse me.,fa
1394,A,"Um, and the, and that's kind of contradictory to what I said",sv
1395,A,"but, you know, you,",%
1396,A,"the,",%
1397,A,you have to be under control so much when they're out,sv
1398,A,"but when they're in school they, they don't have quite, quite as much control, over them as, uh, as what I would liked to have seen.",sv
1399,B,"Right,",b
1400,B,right.,b
1401,B,Right.,b
1402,B,Uh-huh.,b
1403,A,"Uh, uh, I kind of feel like there's, there's too much allowed to go on in at, at school.",sv
1404,B,Uh-huh.,b
1405,A,"And, uh, you know, it tends to, uh, to encourage students to not be as, you know, to not concentrate as much on the education.",sv
1406,B,Uh-huh.,b
1407,A,"You know, they're, they're there for a good time.",sv
1408,B,Right.,b
1409,A,"And, you know, to, to see how little they can get by with.",sv
1410,B,Uh-huh.,b
1411,B,"Well, I know of number of people that are in the, in the, uh, school district down in, in, uh, San Antonio.",sd
1412,B,"And, uh, it seems like it's,",sv
1413,B,"a lot of the problem is to, you know,",sv
1414,B,you always have the lack of funds,sd
1415,B,but it seems to be getting worse and worse,sv
1416,B,"and so they don't settle the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as, as, as, kids need.",sv
1417,A,Right.,b
1418,B,"And, uh, you know, that's just a problem that who knows how that's going to, that's going to come out or anything.",sv
1419,A,"But, uh,",%
1420,B,"But,",%
1421,A,ery faint Yeah.,b
1422,A,"But, uh, I, I don't, I don't know",h
1423,A,"I think, uh, you know, some of the thing has to do with, uh, with the civil rights program.",sv
1424,A,Not that the civil rights program is bad,sv
1425,A,"but that there's,",%
1426,A,"it carried over, into, you know, individual rights",sv
1427,B,Uh-huh.,b
1428,A,"and it, you know, trickled",%
1429,A,"Well, Tom, just tonight, I was working on my car out of necessity,",sd
1430,A,"and I had, uh, uh, had a long age-old problem of my bright lights not working,",sd
1431,A,"uh, this is the type of, uh, switch where you flip the, the lever, the turn signal on the column",sd
1432,B,Yeah.,b
1433,A,"and when I would, uh, put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely,",sd
1434,A,which is even worse than them just not getting bright,sv
1435,B,Exactly.,aa
1436,A,"And I had presumed that it was the switch,",sd
1437,A,"and, uh, this is, uh, an older car,",sd
1438,A,"it's a seventy-two M G,",sd
1439,A,"so I had to mail order the part, uh,",sd
1440,A,"which I had done,",sd
1441,A,"and tonight I went out and, uh, at least hooked in the new part, only to discover that that apparently is not the problem,",sd
1442,A,"it's not in the switch, because it does the same thing with the new switch.",sd
1443,B,Oh.,b
1444,A,"So I'll be faced with having to return that product and, uh, hoping that, uh, you know, that they will accept it,",sd
1445,A,although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used.,sd
1446,B,"Did you do the diagnosis, or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed?",qy
1447,A,"Uh, I had done what diagnosis I could, primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that I did have of the car and, uh, pretty much decided that that had to be the problem.",sd
1448,B,Uh-huh.,b
1449,A,"I talked to one mechanic about it,",sd
1450,A,and he suspected the switch also.,sd
1451,A,"Uh, but I've not, you know,",%
1452,A,I really don't know what the problem might be.,sd
1453,A,"It, it, the other switch could be the main switch itself, uh, that turns the lights on or off, which is on the dashboard",sv
1454,B,Uh-huh.,b
1455,A,"uh, it might be tied into the equation somehow,",sv
1456,A,"but,",%
1457,B,"Yeah, I know,",b
1458,B,"uh, when working with the, uh, flashers, there is, uh, usually a, a special fuse that operates the flashers.",sv
1459,B,Do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam?,qy
1460,A,"I I don't know,",no
1461,A,I should look at that.,sv
1462,A,"I don't remember seeing one in the, uh, in the diagram",sd
1463,B,Diagram.,^2
1464,A,so I'll have to go back and look at that.,sd
1465,B,"Yeah,",b
1466,B,I don't even know if my current cars have a separate fuse.,sd
1467,B,"I know sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same unit, like the headlamp",sd
1468,A,Uh-huh.,b
1469,B,"you tend to think, well, there's one fuse operating the whole thing,",sd
1470,B,"but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires, uh, the use of a, of a maybe a higher fuse.",sd
1471,A,"Yeah,",b
1472,A,that's a good idea.,sv
1473,B,"So, that's a possibility.",sv
1474,A,"What I've typically found when that, uh,",sd
1475,A,"companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all,",sv
1476,A,and I hope that that's the case this time.,sd
1477,B,"Is this a, a mail order parts house that specializes in, in parts for parts for, uh, old imports?",qy
1478,A,"Right,",na
1479,A,exactly,na
1480,B,"Who,",%
1481,A,it's out of Kansas somewhere.,sd
1482,B,Um,b
1483,B,"so, it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that.",qy^d
1484,A,"No,",nn
1485,A,it's not.,sd
1486,A,"I also got a piece of chrome for the, the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car,",sd
1487,A,"but it is not either,",sd
1488,A,"it's obviously doesn't quite fit,",sd
1489,A,"so it must be for a different year,",sd
1490,A,so I'll have to try to return that as well.,sd
1491,B,"Yeah,",b
1492,B,"have you found any, uh, uh, reliable import service people in the metroplex?",qy
1493,A,"Well, I had one person that I used for years and years on this car,",na
1494,A,"because I've owned this car since it was new,",sd
1495,A,"and, uh,",%
1496,A,but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and Inwood area,sd
1497,B,"Oh, yeah.",b
1498,B,Uh-huh.,b
1499,A,"and I hadn't used him for some years,",sd
1500,A,and the last time I called him back it turned out that he had further specialized,sd
1501,A,"instead of, uh, all import cars, he has narrowed it down to where he only works on, uh, German cars and ause German cars",sd
1502,B,I'll be darned.,ba
1503,A,"I'm not sure that he works on much else at all,",sd
1504,A,"but he doesn't work on British cars any more, and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it.",sd
1505,A,"So, uh, uh, I may have to check with that person,",sd
1506,A,"as it turns out that one, that shop is near where I now work.",sd
1507,A,"So, I'll, uh, I should be able to take it in and check that part out.",sd
1508,A,"I've not had to exchange any other parts recently, because they were defective.",sd
1509,A,"Now, I've had, had pretty good luck,",sd
1510,A,"I just, however, did, uh, have to get a, a, uh, one of these jam box portable dual cassette players, uh, repaired.",sd
1511,B,Uh-huh.,b
1512,A,"I purchased it at Sam's,",sd
1513,A,"and I had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty,",sd
1514,A,"and I should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt,",sv
1515,A,"because I didn't take it in right away, and let a whole year go by.",sd
1516,A,"Uh, some of the buttons didn't work right, where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play,",sd
1517,A,"and as it turned out, it had a full year's warranty,",sd
1518,A,and I could have gotten it repaired for free,sd
1519,A,"but I had to take it in,",sd
1520,B,"Oh, my goodness.",ba
1521,A,"while it was in the shop I ended up finding the receipt that I thought had long since been lost,",sd
1522,A,"uh, but it didn't do me any good, because I had, I had missed the window by about a week or two.",sd
1523,B,"Oh, no.",ba
1524,A,"So I didn't even, I didn't really, uh, even bring it up when I went in to pick it up.",sd
1525,A,"But, uh, that's really my only experience in the past year where I've had to take a product back because of a defect.",sd
1526,B,"Well, ours wasn't within the last year.",sd
1527,B,"I guess it's been within the last two years, uh,",sd
1528,B,"Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new,",sd
1529,B,"and it's one with the, uh, electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer, and, uh,",sd
1530,B,"I don't know what else it all controls, but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort,",sd
1531,B,"and we found that the, uh, uh, we were having two problems.",sd
1532,B,"It was idling fast, when you first started the engine, to the point that we park on a hill, under our car port,",sd
1533,B,"and, it, when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley,",sd
1534,B,"and knowing that, you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard,",sd
1535,B,otherwise it would just wrench control away from you.,sd
1536,A,Good grief.,ba
1537,B,"And the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would, uh, be driving along, uh, decelerating, like coming to a stop sign, but not yet stopped at the stop sign",sd
1538,A,Uh-huh.,b
1539,B,and the engine would just quit.,sd
1540,B,"So, we took it back to the, uh, Oldsmobile place and asked them to check it out,",sd
1541,B,"and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing,",sd
1542,B,so they adjusted timing,sd
1543,B,"and the problem didn't go away,",sd
1544,B,"so we ended up taking it back again,",sd
1545,B,"and I don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around,",sd
1546,B,"but the second time around they looked at their, uh, recall service and their service reports from region or headquarters whatever,",sd
1547,B,"and, and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the, uh, computer control unit,",sd
1548,A,Huh.,b
1549,B,"which fortunately they replaced under warranty, because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part",sd
1550,A,My goodness.,ba
1551,B,"and, uh, so once they replaced it, then the, the car seemed to work fine for a considerable period of time,",sd
1552,A,Huh.,b
1553,B,"and now it seems to be,",sd
1554,B,"we we're not experiencing the stalling,",sd
1555,B,"but we're still experiencing a very uneven,",sd
1556,A,Okay.,"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc"
1557,A,What do you think about it?,qo

1559,B,I know they're really strict right now because my husband is from out of the country,sd

1562,A,That's,sv
1563,A,"yeah,",b

1565,A,I worked with Spanish people for about two years,sd

1589,A,"it's amazing to me how, how many things they would allow to occur before, you know, you can come in.",sv
1590,B,Exactly.,aa

1592,A,Right.,b
1593,A,"Yeah,",b
1594,A,"it's kind of frustrating, too, for those who are legitimate now.",sv
1595,B,Exactly.,aa
1596,A,"You know, I think,",%
1597,B,"Well, and, you know, uh, my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life, you know",sd
1598,A,Uh-huh.,b
1599,B,"and they got here,",sd
1600,B,"but now it's a, you know, it's so strict that you can't just do that.",sv
1601,A,"Right,",aa
1602,A,exactly.,aa
1603,A,"And I think it's important that they, you know, they allow a good number of people in every year",sv
1604,A,"because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that, that we don't want to do.",sv
1605,B,I agree.,aa

1607,A,"I don't know,",h
1608,A,"I have, personally I have a problem with it,",sd

1611,B,"If they're not going to be on welfare or, or, or whatever.",sv
1612,B,They're going to be a productive citizen Zen.,sv

1614,B,Yeah.,b
1615,A,"And, I think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in",sv
1616,A,"and,",%
1617,B,"Well, think of how many illegal aliens have, have, have been, uh, uh, sent back to Mexico just to find their way back.",sv
1618,A,"Yeah,",b
1619,A,"and that's, that's what I think.",sv
1620,A,"You know, I, I have to laugh",sd
1621,A,"because, like I said, I worked with a lot of those",sd
1622,A,and they'd been deported two or three times,sd

1625,B,that's our money.,sv
1626,B,"Yes,",aa
1627,B,that's true.,sv

1631,B,"I, I think",%
1632,B,"I, I agree.",aa

1636,B,boy,ba
1637,B,"this is spur of the moment, uh,",h
1638,B,"but, I, I don't really see any, any changes that I think of really blatant right now",sv

1640,A,"Yeah,",aa
1641,A,absolutely.,aa
1642,A,"I think a lot of times we take, you know, basically who we want to",sv
1643,A,"because if you, if you have connections, it's a lot easier to get in.",sv
1644,B,Exactly.,aa
1645,B,Connections and money.,^2
1646,A,"Yeah,",aa
1647,A,"and I think, you know, it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent, you know. And that it should be equal to all",sv
1648,B,Yeah.,b
1649,A,"and then not like the United States,",sv
1650,A,"basically, it's not who you know,",sv
1651,A,"it it doesn't become a thing of who you know, but, but how the type of person you are.",sv
1652,B,I agree.,aa
1653,A,"And it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people, like probably your husband, can get in",sv
1654,B,Yeah,b
1655,B,"Well, we got him past that,",sd
1656,B,"but, uh,",%
1657,A,"Well, great.",ba

1661,A,is there anything I believe in,qy
1662,B,I think that's it.,sv
1663,B,Is this like a very short call?,qy
1664,A,"No,",nn

1667,A,"It's good hearing your, your point of view",sd
1668,A,and I think that's neat.,sv
1669,A,I think we agree a lot on that,sv

1680,A,"Well, seems to me the, one of the reasons that people don't go out to vote is maybe they're bored with the whole election process.",sv
1681,B,"Well, I agree with the boredom of the election process,",aa
1682,B,"but I also, uh, think that people don't realize that their boat, vote will make a difference.",sv
1683,B,"Uh, they feel like that, you know, it's going to go however it's going to go",sv
1684,B,and their one little vote is not going to make that much difference,sv
1685,B,"and it's, just why make the effort.",sd
1686,A,"Well, sometimes, strangely enough, one vote has made the difference.",sv
1687,B,"Well, I agree with that",aa
1688,B,"and I, and I do know that, you know, all those votes are counted",sd
1689,B,"and, and they do make a difference.",sv
1690,B,"Uh, also I think that people have a tendency to, to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the, the more local elections.",sv
1691,A,"Well, it's kind of strange",sv
1692,A,because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day-to-day lives.,sd
1693,B,"Exactly,",aa
1694,B,"and, I, I even have a tendency to do that myself.",sd
1695,B,"And I have to really make a concerted effort to, to get involved.",sd
1696,B,"I live, I live in a suburb in Mesquite",sd
1697,B,"and, uh, so I really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what's going to because that directly affects me.",sd
1698,B,"But I, I think on the whole, most people don't, uh, feel that way.",sv
1699,B,"Or don't look, even look at that.",sv
1700,B,"I think they just don't even,",sv
1701,B,"I, I don't think they're conscious of it.",sv
1702,A,"Well, maybe part of the problem is they don't, they think they have enough choices.",sv
1703,B,"Well, that may be true, too.",sv
1704,B,I hadn't thought of that.,sd
1705,A,"You know, in some of the European countries, they have numbers of parties that run",sd
1706,A,and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country.,sd
1707,B,"Uh-huh,",b
1708,B,right.,b
1709,B,"And sometimes it's, uh,",%
1710,B,"well, not sometimes, but many times it's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign",sv
1711,B,"and, and issues get, uh, bogged down.",sd
1712,A,"Well, maybe it's a matter of, you know, voter awareness.",sv
1713,B,"Uh, I think voter awareness,",%
1714,B,"I, I did some work for the, uh, Women's League of, uh, Voters, uh, several years ago",sd
1715,B,"and, I think there are some organizations that used to, uh, do some voter awareness, uh, things.",sv
1716,B,They don't get a lot of participation.,sd
1717,B,"They don't get a lot of, uh, activity.",sd
1718,B,"Most of the League of Women Voters, what they did was they put out information, so that it, it would just be made available to everyone.",sd
1719,B,"Now, other areas that I've worked in, like in the chambers, they would just have the candidates come",sd
1720,B,"and it would just, you know,",%
1721,B,that was not a lot of community involvement,sv
1722,B,and those were people that would mostly vote anyway.,sv
1723,A,"Well, I think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long.",sv
1724,A,"In Britain, you know, they have a set period of time",sd
1725,A,"and, and for campaign, that's it.",sd
1726,A,"In this country, it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign.",sv
1727,B,"It's a, it's an ongoing campaign",aa
1728,B,and it's expensive campaign,sv
1729,B,"and it, it, uh, eliminates a lot of qualified people.",sv
1730,B,"Uh, maybe more qualified and, uh, more dedicated to the issues.",sv
1731,A,"Well, the, they don't want to spend the time",sv
1732,A,or they don't have the money.,sv
1733,B,"Exactly,",aa

1735,B,"and it, it,",%
1736,B,"I, I can't I just can't believe,",sd
1737,B,"I've, I've worked in a couple of local campaigns.",sd
1738,B,I just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally.,sd
1739,A,"Well, it's a matter of name recognition.",sv
1740,A,People aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of.,sv
1741,B,"Oh, well, I agree with that,",aa
1742,B,"but also,",%
1743,B,"and I, and I'm not for controlling how much is spent,",sd
1744,B,"but do you know,",%
1745,B,"that's one thing,",sv
1746,B,"if a, if the time wasn't so,",%
1747,B,"if it wasn't such a long, uh, campaigning time, then they couldn't spend as much money.",sd
1748,A,And even debates don't seem to help much.,sv
1749,B,"No,",aa
1750,B,they really don't.,sv
1751,B,"Uh, it's it's, a lot of it is who looks the best, who, uh, who happens to say the right thing at the right time, who, not, who may not be the most qualified and can get the uh, the job done.",sv
1752,A,So we're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers.,bf

2325,B,"but my, uh, uncle has moved in with her to take care of her",sd
2326,A,Uh-huh.,b

2328,A,"Right,",b
2329,A,especially for your uncle I bet.,qy^d
2330,B,Oh yes.,ny
2331,B,Yes.,ny
2332,A,Now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer.,sd
2333,A,Do they have anything like that in Dallas.,qy
2334,B,"In Dallas,",^h
2335,B,"uh, yeah.",ny
2336,B,"I've, I've heard of several things",sd
2337,B,"and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them,",sv
2338,B,"but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or, uh, to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up.",sv
2339,A,Right.,b
2340,A,So they are pretty limited.,bf
2341,B,Right.,aa
2342,A,"Oh, another interesting thing,",sv
2343,A,"another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them, sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives. To make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities.",sd
2344,B,Oh really.,b
2345,B,Uh-huh.,b
2346,A,"I don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients, but just patients, people in general who were not as independent as they use to be.",sv
2347,B,"Uh-huh,",b
2348,B,uh-huh.,b
2349,B,"Well, it, it's, it's a really, day care programs are really neat, you know",sv
2350,B,"and if the, if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that, that is one of the best things to do,",sv
2351,B,but I think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them,sv
2352,A,Uh-huh ery faint.,b
2353,A,Right.,b
2354,B,"and I think that's in a way it's more, some, an area where some of the day care, uh, programs have left off",sv
2355,A,Uh-huh.,b
2356,B,because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those.,sd
2357,A,Right,b
2358,A,"to, uh, get there and to participate in the activities.",sd
2359,B,Right.,b
2360,B,"Cause I know, there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas.",sd

2373,B,Uh-huh.,ny
2374,B,Uh-huh.,ny
2375,A,You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way.,sv
2376,B,And they love to recollect.,sd
2377,B,"I mean they just, you know,",%

2381,B,My grandmother doesn't,ng

2389,B,"Um,",^h
2390,B,"I lived, I lived in Sweden for two years.",sd
2391,A,Uh-huh.,b
2392,B,And in Sweden they have socialized medicine.,sd
2393,B,And so I saw some of the good,sd
2394,B,and also I saw some of the bad that results from such a program.,sd
2395,A,Uh-huh.,b
2396,B,"Uh, some of the, some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care.",sv
2397,A,Right.,b
2398,B,"So it's a very, it's a very, uh, comfortable,",sv
2399,B,"I mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that, you know, there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life.",sv
2400,A,Right.,b
2401,B,"Um, the bad was more apparent I think at least for me",sv
2402,B,"because I think it affected people's lives on, in a way that you could see.",sv
2403,B,"One, one thing that I noticed is it's very, very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden.",sv
2404,A,"Oh, really?",bh
2405,B,Because it's treated as a disease.,sd
2406,B,"Now I don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine,",sd
2407,B,"but, uh, if you're, if you're alcoholic, then you're treated as if you're on disability, long-term disability",sd
2408,B,and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that.,sv
2409,A,Huh.,b
2410,B,"Also, um, another thing that, that I noticed that was very strange,",sv
2411,B,"I was, uh, I would go down all these, uh, uh,",sd
2412,B,I remember this one row of houses,sd
2413,B,"and they were, uh, row houses or townhouses, all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing.",sd
2414,A,Uh-huh.,b
2415,B,"Well, it would be lower middle-class housing here.",sv
2416,B,It's probably middle-class housing there.,sv
2417,A,Uh-huh.,b
2418,B,"Um, and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these",sd
2419,B,and there was a doctor that lived in one of these.,sd
2420,B,The one guy was a doctor,sd
2421,B,"and one was a taxi driver,",sd
2422,B,"and so their, their incomes were about the same.",sd
2423,A,Huh.,b
2424,B,"Whereas here, there is a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward.",sv
2425,A,Right.,b
2426,B,"And that, that didn't exist in Sweden.",sd
2427,A,Right.,b
2428,B,"And, uh, overall I their, their health care suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower",sv
2429,B,"and it was, it was less professional",sv
2430,B,"and it was treated more, like a, like a taxi driver type job, then a, then a doctor type job.",sv
2431,A,Yeah.,b
2432,A,"that is, uh, that is something I've heard.",aa
2433,A,"Uh, I had a friend, uh, that I worked with that was from Sweden",sd
2434,A,"and that was, uh,",%
2435,A,"probably the, the major concern I have is that, you know, we are leading in the technology realm of, of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to, to get into, uh, the medical field,",sv
2436,A,but at the same time it's real hard.,sv
2437,A,I mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance,sd
2438,A,"and so, you know, I'm real, you know,",%
2439,A,"it's like well, you know, you know,",%
2440,A,"there's got to be better ways, you know, to do some things",sv

2442,A,"the, the competition, in a lot of ways is, is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor",sv
2443,A,"and, and, uh, they have to compete to be, to be good and to be knowledgeable.",sd
2444,A,"But at the same time, there's a, you know, they're regulating themselves",sv

2446,A,"My, I have a brother who's a vet",sd
2447,A,"and for something that he can get, you know, wholesale",sd

2449,B,Right.,b
2450,A,"you know, they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item",sv
2451,A,and that's ridiculous.,sv

2454,B,You don't think it's abnormal?,qy^d
2455,A,I don't think it's abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all,sv

2458,B,you're just saying it's common.,bf

2462,A,but I think people are too lawsuit happy.,sv
2463,A,And I mean things will happen,sv
2464,A,"and, and you've got to, uh, keep up",sv

2468,A,"there are some people that I'm sure make mistakes because they just don't keep on top of it,",sv

3077,A,"And then I, it's like well the thrill is gone",%
3078,A,so let's do something else.,sd
3079,B,Right.,aa
3080,B,"You want to, uh, explore a new field",bf
3081,B,"or, or,",%
3082,A,"Well, yeah,",aa
3083,A,"I, I'm signed up for a class in pottery making because I've never tried that yet",sd
3084,B,"Huh. So you have a M F A in, in what division of art?",qw
3085,A,"but,",%
3086,A,"Well, I, I actually have a Masters of art",sd
3087,A,and it's in art education.,sd
3088,B,"Oh, okay.",bk
3089,A,"So, I'm a licensed teacher",sd
3090,A,"but jobs being what they are, I substitute teach",sd
3091,B,Yeah.,b
3092,A,and that way I have time for my kids too.,sd
3093,A,And I've been fortunate that I can afford to work part-time.,sv
3094,A,I don't know how long that's going to last,sd
3095,B,"Oh, yeah.",b
3096,A,"And, uh, they're cutting back,",sd
3097,A,so I don't go in all that often,sd
3098,A,"but I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of things.",sd
3099,A,"Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars",sd
3100,A,"and I say, oh no",sd
3101,A,"and , and I go",sd
3102,A,and I make it.,sd
3103,B,Yeah.,b
3104,A,That's how I started jewelry making.,sd
3105,A,"I, I love to cook.",sd
3106,B,"Oh, that's great.",ba
3107,A,"And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of stuff",sd
3108,A,and I went,sd
3109,A,"and I signed up for class because then again, you get, you know, get someone to guide you",sd
3110,A,and you get the tools you don't feel like buying.,sd
3111,B,Exactly.,aa
3112,A,And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars,sd
3113,A,It took me a lot of time,sd
3114,A,"but  it didn't,",sd
3115,B,"Oh, yeah.",b
3116,A,"but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know,",sd
3117,A,"and then I,",%
3118,B,"And your time,",^2
3119,B,then you're that much farther ahead,sv
3120,A,Yeah.,b
3121,A,"Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons.",sd
3122,A,It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.,sd
3123,B,Right.,b
3124,B,I've seen them,sd
3125,B,"and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in",sd
3126,B,"and,",sd
3127,A,"Oh, yeah.",b
3128,A,Uh-huh.,b
3129,B,That's neat.,sv
3130,A,"I went there,",sd
3131,A,we have Home Depot out here.,sd
3132,A,I don't know if you've heard of it.,qy^d
3133,A,I went,sd
3134,A,and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.,sd
3135,B,Yes.,ny
3136,B,We have one.,sd
3137,A,I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath,sd
3138,A,and cutting that wedge out was no joke,sd
3139,B,Huh.,b
3140,B,"Oh, I'm, I'm sure.",ba
3141,A,"We did it on a, I had a, uh, I did it through Adult Ed again.",sd
3142,B,A band saw?,qy^d
3143,B,What?,br
3144,A,I did it through Adult Ed again.,sd
3145,B,Uh-huh.,b
3146,A,"And the teacher was one of these negative people,",sd
3147,A,"oh that's dangerous,",^q
3148,A,"we can't do that,",^q
3149,A,we just can't do that.,^q
3150,A,And I'm going well how about this way?,sd
3151,A,"I, I want to do that,",^q
3152,A,that was the plan here,^q
3153,B,Right.,b
3154,A,So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it.,sd
3155,B,A cradle for it.,^2
3156,B,"Yeah,",b
3157,B,so you can steady it,bf
3158,B,"and then, you used a handsaw or a backsaw?",qy
3159,A,"Well, it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw",sd
3160,A,"but there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that",sd
3161,B,"Right,",b
3162,B,right.,b
3163,A,and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw.,sd
3164,A,"I said I'm not that steady,",sd
3165,A,it's not going to happen.,^q
3166,B,Yeah.,b
3167,A,So we built a cradle for it,sd
3168,A,"and we got once it was turned, we got one one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw,",sd
3169,A,by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about,sd
3170,B,Right.,b
3171,A,"So,",%
3172,B,Now did you cut a quarter wedge in this?,qy
3173,A,"Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth.",ng
3174,A,You know,%
3175,B,"Well, I, I'm envisioning, uh, uh, a a watermelon like a log",sd
3176,B,"and then, uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, uh, the, uh,",%
3177,B,"it's, uh,",sd
3178,B,"if you're looking at adding on you have,",sd
3179,A,"Up here in Rochester, uh, we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution.",sd
3180,A,I think Grand Rapids was number one.,sd
3181,A,"Uh, we really don't have too much of a problem as far as, uh, industry since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here.",sd
3182,A,But we do have the same problem a lot of other areas up here in the northeast have,sd
3183,A,and that is the effects of acid rain. coming basically from coal plants in Ohio and Illinois and Indiana.,sv
3184,B,Right.,b
3185,B,"Well, that's true.",aa
3186,B,"Actually down here we don't have a big problem with, uh, with air pollution.",sd
3187,B,Mainly because we don't have anybody to to either side of us.,sv
3188,B,"Uh, which helps out a lot as far as that goes.",sd
3189,B,"I wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when I lived up in Boston and up in, uh, you know,",sd
3190,B,"debates would come up up there in Massachusetts and, you know, in that area over, uh, air pollution",sd
3191,B,"and their attitude's, basically, well, prevailing ins, winds are to the east",sd
3192,B,so why should we have to worry.,^q
3193,A,Yeah.,b
3194,A,"I've, I've, uh, was in Los Angeles once",sd
3195,A,and that was quite a difference as far as pollution goes.,sd
3196,A,I mean you couldn't really see that much,sv
3197,A,"Every once in a while we have these air inversions, the weather inversions",sd
3198,B,"Oh, yes",b
3199,B,"nothing,",%
3200,A,and then it gets hazy around here,sd
3201,A,"but they're really,",%
3202,A,we don't have a big problem with it.,sd
3203,A,"I think that, uh, what most of the people here in New York state are going after right now is,",sv
3204,A,"it's, it's the, uh, ongoing acid rain problem.",sd
3205,A,"Especially out in the, uh, uh, Adirondack areas where, you know, the lakes are becoming, uh, changing the acidity of the lakes",sv
3206,A,"and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants, uh, or alkaline liking plants are not lasting anymore because the soil levels, the p H is changing as this acid rain continues to fall.",sd
3207,B,Right.,b
3208,A,And I know that there's been battles over the states up here.,sd
3209,A,"Uh, you know, Governor Mario going after, you know, governors of Ohio and and Indiana to fix what's going on down there.",sd
3210,A,"I remember when I was in Florida,",sd
3211,A,"the only problem was that it seemed like it may,",sd
3212,A,"it wasn't really pollution, just the steamy weather <laughter>.",sd
3213,B,"Oh absolutely,",aa
3214,B,"yeah,",aa
3215,B,just muggy.,sv
3216,B,"So, yes",aa
3217,B,"I think,",%
3218,B,"yeah,",aa
3219,B,I think you're right.,sv
3220,B,Our most pollute substance down here is just water.,sv
3221,B,"But I I, I, I think, you know, the biggest causes even then a lot of times are, uh, uh, like when I was up in Boston just all the cars. You know, just all over the place.",sv
3222,A,Yeah,b
3223,A,"it,",%
3224,B,"You just got a lot of, you know, a lot of pollution from those",sv
3225,B,"and, uh, you know, if you don't have a wind, it sticks around.",sd
3226,A,"Oh, yeah.",b
3227,A,"I, you know, I was in Boston once",sd
3228,A,"and I remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour, even with the Tee.",sd
3229,A,"Uh, just this, it looked like billions of cars massing",sd
3230,B,Absolutely.,aa
3231,A,and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go.,sv
3232,A,"I mean, yeah, that's what's in, you know, Los Angeles is,",sv
3233,A,I think that's biggest problem,sv
3234,A,"because when I was in Los Angeles for a time, it's all, you know, from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city.",sv
3235,B,Right.,b
3236,A,"And there's really, there's nowhere for this to be absorbed, really.",sd
3237,A,"Uh, tree planting sometimes can handle, you know, stopping some of the air pollution and that and help",sv
3238,A,but if you have nowhere to do anything.,sd
3239,B,"That's, that's very true.",aa
3240,B,"Uh, you know, of course then when, when you're not recycling, you've got these incendiary plants and stuff, that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere.",sv
3241,B,"But I, you know, you've got, you've got the industry,",sd
3242,B,"you've got that,",sd
3243,B,and you got the cars.,sd
3244,B,"I think the cars are where, where it's at right now as far as pollution goes, air pollution I mean.",sv
3245,A,Yeah.,b
3246,A,"I, you know, Florida doesn't seem to be, at least maybe Miami,",sv
3247,A,"but I, I, uh, you know,",%
3248,A,"Fort Lauderdale I, I don't know what the big industries are down there, uh,",sd
3249,A,"but, you know, up here we have Kodak",sd
3250,B,Right.,b
3251,A,and that's the worst polluter.,sv
3252,A,"They put, uh, uh,",%
3253,A,you can smell ether in the air sometimes,sd
3254,A,It keeps the neighborhoods happy I guess.,sv
3255,B,I guess so.,aa
3256,A,"Uh, cause they clean the, uh, the lenses for cameras",sd
3257,A,"and they, they make film here",sd
3258,A,and they're the worst offender,sv
3259,A,"but it's, you know, it's under so much control.",sv
3260,A,"You know, sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them",sd
3261,A,but that's really getting under control now.,sv
3262,B,Right.,b
3263,B,"I, you know, I don't know in air what they do.",sd
3264,B,"Uh, I, I haven't run across any major pollutants down there that I've, I've really seen a lot of, you know, about.",sd
3265,B,"Uh, I, I know I've seen like, uh,",%
3266,B,"my grandparents live in Corpus Christi, Texas",sd
3267,B,"and I know they've, there's a lot of refineries down there",sd
3268,B,"and that, that's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air.",sv
3269,B,"I, but I don't know how, uh, you know,",sd
3270,B,"there's a difference in what you can smell and what you, uh, you know, what's bad.",sv
3271,A,"Be interesting to see when, as Mexico develops industrially whether, you know, without,",sv
